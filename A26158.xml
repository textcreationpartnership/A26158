            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMONGST the many Artifices which the Devil makes uſe of to deprive Men of Heaven and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs, there has none been more fatally ſucceſsful, than the prepoſſeſſing their Minds with a falſe Notion, That the way that leads thither is ſo narrow, that 'tis unpaſſable; the Gate ſo ſtraight, that there is no entring thro' it, and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a good Life ſo great, that they are altogether inſuperable. 'Tis commonly thought that when Men enter upon a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Courſe of Life, they muſt bid adieu to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103240:5"/>the World, and all its Pleaſures and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and deny themſelves the moſt innocent Gratifications of Senſe: They muſt give themſelves up to a thoughtful, melancholy, and moroſe way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and retire from all good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and agreeable Converſation; that their whole time muſt be ſpent in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe uneaſie Duties of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Self-denial, and taking up the Croſs; and in ſhort, that 'tis impoſſible for them to live religiouſly, and to live pleaſantly. And therefore ſince they have not any ſenſible Demonſtration of the Happineſs of the other World, they are reſolv'd to enjoy as much as they can in this, and to make ſure of their Portion here, whatſoever becomes of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Whereas could they be perſwaded to make Tryal for ſome time of a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious Life, would they but give themſelves up for ſome conſiderable ſpace to the Practice of Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they muſt needs be convinced, that the moſt likely way to lead a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cheerful, and pleaſant Life, is, <hi>to fear God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.13.</note> 
               <hi>and obey his commandments;</hi> and that our Happineſs doth conſiſt in the performance of our Duty.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11.</note> For even <hi>in keeping his commandments there is great reward, and Godlineſs has the Promiſes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103240:5"/>the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</hi>

            <p>As will appear by conſidering,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a religious Life promotes our Happineſs in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It fits and prepares us for the Enjoyment of everlaſting Happineſs, in the Life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A religious Life promotes our Happineſs in this World. And this it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By promoting the Intereſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, and, 2. Of every private and particular Perſon.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Obedience to the Precepts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, promotes the Intereſt of Mankind in General. The deſign of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governour of the world, is to make all his Creatures as happy as their Capacities will admit of, and therefore he has ſuited his Laws to the Nature of thoſe Beings, which are to be govern'd by them; that by the obſervance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they may not only pay him that Homage which he requires of them, but promote their own Happineſs alſo. For the ſame end he ſent his Son into the world, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a publick Bleſſing to all the Nations of the Earth: And therefore all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103240:6"/>thoſe Articles of Faith, and Precepts of Morality which he taught his followers, were equally for the Intereſt of all Men to believe and practiſe; nay, they are made more or leſs neceſſary, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Tendency to promote the good of Societies, and the well being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Hence Self-love (when excluſive of the love of our Neighbour) is brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo odious a Character in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ; and on the contrary, the Duties of Charity, Love, Peaceableneſs, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Temperance, and Juſtice; are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated and recommended to us in the Goſpel: Becauſe where thoſe are duly and conſcientiouſly practiſed, Princes will be ſecure in their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the People in their Liberties; the Church will ſupport the State, and the State protect the Church; Parents will be tenderly affected towards their Off-ſpring, and Children dutiful towards their Parents; Maſters will be faithfully ſerv'd, and Servants well uſed; all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Men will ſerve God and their Countrey, in their ſeveral Places and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hereby promote the Weal and flouriſhing Condition of thoſe Kingdoms in which they live; Neighbour Nations will forget their mutual Quarrels and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities,

            <p n="2">II. 'Tis the Intereſt of every private and particular Perſon, to lead a Godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life. Which will plainly appear from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is very little true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be found in a debauch'd and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſe of Life.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the way to lead a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Life even in this world, is to be vertuous and religious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the worſt Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a good Man can fall into, are to be preferr'd before the moſt proſperous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Wicked: And if ſo, then certainly 'tis the true Intereſt of every one, to lead a Holy and religious Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis evident, that there is very little true Pleaſure to be found in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and wicked Courſe of Life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. A wicked Courſe of Life is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Dictates of a Man's own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For ſince Man is a reaſonable Being, God has enjoyn'd him a reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and therefore he who diſobeys the Laws of God, muſt do violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103240:7"/>and Act contrary to the Dictates of his own mind. God has indulg'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in all the reaſonable Gratifications of his ſenſual Appetites; he has furniſhed this World like a plentiful Store-houſe, with all things neceſſary for his Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and Delight; and permitted and allowed him to taſte of every Sweet, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which his Soul deſires, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he keeps within the Bounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice, Temperance and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that his Affections are not too much ſet upon them, or his precious time too long taken up, in the purſuit of them. God is not ſo hard a Maſter as to create Mankind with ſtrong Propenſions and Appetites, and then to tye him up from the Gratification of them; to ſhew him Pleaſures and agreeable Objects, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him the Satisfaction of enjoying them: No, the great Father and Benefactor of Mankind ſincerely deſires, and has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for our Happineſs in this World, as well as the next; and reſtrains us only from the abuſe of his Creatures, and an inordinate and exceſſive Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards them. He delights to ſee Men live ſutably to their Natures, and pleaſe themſelves with the rational Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a harmleſs and innocent Life: And 'tis our own Sin and Folly which makes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103240:7"/>us miſerable, faſtens us to the Oar,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> and obliges us to that hard Condition, of <hi>getting our bread with the Sweat of our brows.</hi> In the State of Innocency, Man's Reaſon gave bounds to his Deſires; his Will was ſufficient to govern his Actions, and to conduct him to Happineſs: But when he fell from his Integrity, the Faculties of his Soul, were weaken'd and diſorder'd; his Paſſions grew ſo head-ſtrong, that he was not able to reſtrain them within their due Bounds, without the aſſiſtance of a ſupernatural Power. And from this rage and diſorder of our Paſſions, all our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Deſires after unlawful Pleaſure do proceed; which muſt needs diſturb the Happineſs of that Soul wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. For every ſinful Luſt we entertain in our Souls, is a deflection from the Laws of right Reaſon; every ſin that we commit, is a baſe, a fooliſh, and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Act; 'tis below the Dignity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by conſequence contrary to our true Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pleaſures of a wicked Life are precarious and uncertain; either we may be ſnatch'd away from them, or thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights may leave and forſake us. 'Twas the obſervation of the Philoſopher long ago; that nothing can make us Happy which is not in our own Power: For 'tis the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103240:8"/>next ſtep to Miſery to conſider, that for ought we know, the very next moment this may be our Condition. Every Age, and every Kingdom will furniſh us with Inſtances more than enough, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of worldly Pleaſure: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of <hi>Saul</hi> was fruſtrated when he had got <hi>David</hi> into his Net; and <hi>Herod's</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity vaniſh'd in the midſt of his Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the Worms became the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of God's juſt Indignation againſt him. The <hi>rich Man</hi> in the Goſpel had no ſooner ſung a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul, but he had this Sentence pronounced againſt him,
<note place="margin">Luk 12.20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou fool, this night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> Nay, frequently a vain and cauſeleſs Fear ſtrips us of all theſe Enjoyments; and they are ſo truly the Creatures of Phancy, that upon the leaſt alteration of our fickle and unſtable Minds, they vaniſh and diſappear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Pleaſures of a ſinful Life are but ſhort at the beſt. Though nothing ſhould interrupt them, yet they fade of themſelves, <hi>and paſs away like a Tale that is told:</hi> They yield us ſome little Amuſement for the preſent, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our Thoughts from more ſerious and profitable Employments; but are of no longer Duration than the preſent moment. We our ſelves cannot continue long in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103240:8"/>the World; and if we could, yet we ſhould either loſe the reliſh of Pleaſure; or, what is worſe, it would grow nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and burthenſome to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Sinful Pleaſures are attended with perpetual Fears and miſgivings of Conſcience. And here let me appeal to every ones Experience, whether Shame and Confuſion do not ſeize upon him, and Horror ſtrike through his Soul, whilſt he is in the Commiſſion of any wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Doth he not (like his firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi>) run away from the Preſence of his God, as aſham'd of his own Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or ſew Fig-leaves together, make ſome poor Excuſes to cover it? Thus it is at firſt, till Conſcience is either lull'd aſleep or ſear'd, and Cuſtom in ſinning has, in ſome meaſure, taken off the dread of that Puniſhment which is due to it; and becauſe Vengeance ſeems to ſlumber, the hardned Sinner is the leſs apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of it: And yet for all this his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſometimes awakes, lays before him the things he had done, Arraigns and Condemns him for them. When he lies on a Sick-bed, or ſome grievous Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Calamity befalls him, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls his wandring Thoughts, brings to his Mind the Actions of his paſt Life, and ſhews them to him in a true Light, and in their proper Colours.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103240:9"/>
            <p>This calms the Rage and hurry of his Paſſions, diſpels the Fumes of Senſuality, and gives him a true Proſpect of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And then he begins naturally thus to Reaſon with himſelf; What if there ſhould at laſt be a God, whom I have made it my buſineſs all my Life long to affront? What if there ſhould be a day of Account, and a State of everlaſting Bliſs or Miſery? What a miſerable Condition am I in; loſt and undone to all Eternity? I have indeed liv'd a Life of Pleaſure and Senſuality; I have indulg'd my ſelf in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which my Heart could wiſh: But alas! all thoſe Delights are now fled away; there now remains nothing of them, but the uneaſie remembrance: I have nothing to expect from a Juſt and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, but eternal Miſery and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments. Such Reflections as theſe do frequently break in upon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Liver, theſe miſgivings of Mind, do haunt and purſue him; and will not ſuffer him to go on quietly in his wicked Courſes; but render him uneaſie here, as well as miſerable hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The way to lead a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Life, even in this World; is to be vertuous and religious. This is evident,</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103240:9"/>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe the leading of a Vertuous and religious Life, is the moſt likely means to obtain the good things of this World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Becauſe it heightens and improves the Enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The leading of a Vertuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life, is the moſt likely means to obtain the good things of this World. Now the Goods of this World may be reduc'd to theſe three Heads. 1. Health and long Life. 2. Riches. 3. Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An honeſt, vertuous, and religious Life, is the moſt proper Courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Health and prolong our Lives. For Religion teaches us to be ſober, chaſt, and temperate; to avoid all exceſs in Meat, Drink or Sleep, which lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt Diſeaſes, and breaks off the thread of our Lives: It teaches us to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Paſſions, and to keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their due Bounds; and hereby procures ſuch an even and ſteady temper of Mind, as contains the Blood in its due Ferment, the Humours in their proper Channels, and promotes Health, and a vigorous Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>for they ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi> Saith our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>(i.e.)</hi> a quiet, meek, and humble frame of Spirit will conduce very much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103240:10"/>our days in this World, and prevent thoſe Broils and Quarrels (occaſion'd by exorbitant Paſſion) which bring ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men to untimely ends. And Laſtly, It teaches us to ſerve God, and to live up to the end for which we were created; whereby we obtain ſuch inward Comfort and Satisfaction of mind, <hi>The Feaſt of a good Conſcience,</hi> as renders us of a pleaſant Humour, and chearful Diſpoſition; which, as the wiſe Man obſerves,
<note place="margin">Prov: 17.22.</note> 
               <hi>doth good like a Medicine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A vertuous and religious Life, is the moſt likely means to make us rich: By encouraging us to be induſtrious in our ſeveral Callings, honeſt in our Dealings, frugal in our Expences (which are the moſt proper means of getting and keeping Riches) and diverting us from all thoſe expenſive Vices; of Gaming, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Laſciviouſneſs, which have conſumed ſo many Eſtates, and <hi>brought many a Man to a Morſel of bread.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, it brings the Bleſſing of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, and gives Succeſs to our honeſt Endeavours; ſo that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtand amaz'd at our own Plenty, as being hardly able to reconcile our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with our Expences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For Honour and Reputation: Theſe are ſcarce ever known to be obtain'd, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103240:10"/>by a Life led according to the Rules of Vertue and Honeſty. For tho' a wicked Man may have Titles heap'd upon him, and derive his Pedigree from a long Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of illuſtrious Anceſtors; tho' he may be followed by a numerous Train of Servants and Dependants, and have the Shouts and Acclamations of the Rabble, and be ador'd by his ſervile Flatterers as a God; tho' they may applaud every word he ſpeaks as if it were an Oracle; yet 'tis plain, that they deſpiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Man, whilſt they adore his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: 'Tis not the Aſs but the golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage he bears, they fall down to; for whenever the Scale of Fortune turns, and this great wicked Man falls into Poverty and Diſgrace, he becomes the Scorn and Laughing-ſtook of his moſt ſuppliant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers; and thoſe very Perſons who ſtrove who ſhould careſs and tickle him with the moſt fulſome Flattery, will then as earneſtly contend, who ſhall treat him with the moſt remarkable Ignominy and Contempt. Thus the great <hi>Sejanus,</hi> whilſt he was the Favourite of his Prince, was the Idol of the People alſo: But when he fell into Diſgrace with <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> then no Indignity was omitted, which their Rage and Madneſs could invent; and the moſt infamous Death was thought too
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103240:11"/>good for him: Then one might have heard the Crowd giving vent, to the juſt reſentments of their Minds, which before fear made them ſuppreſs. Says one, I always had an ill Opinion of that Man; I thought he climb'd too high to ſtand long, and that his indirect and wicked Courſes, would one time or other meet with a juſt Reward. Says another, I was of the ſame Opinion; and though my dependance on him oblig'd me to give him ſome external Homage, and to worſhip him for the ſame reaſon, 'tis ſaid the <hi>Indians</hi> do the Devil; yet I could never endure him in my Heart: I always hated the Man and his Vices. But on the contrary, that Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which is obtain'd by a Vertuous and religious Life, is of a more durable ſtamp, and rather encreas'd than diminiſh'd by Adverſity. A time of Tryal makes the good Man's Vertues more remarkable, exerciſes his Graces, and the Furnace of Affliction purifies and refines them. A true Sterling Vertue will be honour'd and admir'd in all Conditions, in all places, and at all times. Good Men naturally love and ſpeak well of that which is Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and commendable, all Love being founded in likeneſs and ſimilitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and even wicked Men cannot but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103240:11"/>reverence that Vertue and Integrity, which they will not be at the Pains to Practiſe. And now for a concluſion of this Point, let me appeal to your Experience; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ordinary Courſe of the World, Health, Riches, and Reputation are not for the moſt part the Rewards of leading a good and vertuous Life. And as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on furniſhes us with the good things of this World: So,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It heightens and improves the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them: It enables us to take the Comfort of thoſe good things we enjoy,
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.8.</note> and makes <hi>a little better with Righteouſneſs, than great revenues without right.</hi> And this it performs,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By making us content with our Lot and Portion in this World, and freeing our Minds from all thoſe anxious and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous thoughts, which render the Lives of many Men uneaſie to them, who abound with every good thing which their Heart can wiſh. For the good Man believes, that all things are govern'd by a wiſe and gracious God, who beſt knows the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his own hands, and what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt proper for every Man; and has furniſh'd him with ſuitable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and Endowments, and entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with ſuch a Portion of this worlds
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103240:12"/>Goods, as 'tis convenient for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: He is alſo well aſſured, that God is a Being of infinite Love and Kindneſs to Mankind,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> Truth and Faithfulneſs; and <hi>will make all things work together for the good of thoſe that ſerve him:</hi> So that tho' his Condition is not ſo high or great, ſo gay and ſplendid as other Mens; nay, tho' he meets with many Croſſes and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet he reſts very well contented and ſatisfied with it; becauſe he knows, upon the whole, 'tis that which is beſt for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By giving us an Heart to take the Comfort of thoſe good things we enjoy; and laying down the wiſeſt and moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Rules and Directions how we may do ſo; and teaching us that Golden Rule of Moderation in the Enjoyment of them, which renders the good things of this world, Bleſſings indeed. For 'tis the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Unhappineſs of Mankind, that they know not how to keep a Mean; either their Deſires are too profuſe and laviſh, or elſe too narrow and bound up. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men in the world are there to whom God has indulg'd Health, Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and all that their Hearts can wiſh; and yet has not given them the Power to eat thereof: So that they reap no other benefit by all thoſe good things, <hi>ſaving the beholding of them with their eyes;</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103240:12"/>whilſt they abound in Wealth and Plenty, labour under all the Miſery, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which attend the extreameſt Want and Poverty? Nay, they are the poorer for God's Liberality towards them; and as their Riches encreaſe, ſo their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires encreaſe with them. On the other ſide, how common is it to ſee Men drown their Parts as well as Fortunes, and render themſelves ſo ſtupid and ſottiſh, that even their Vices grow nauſeous to them? Now Religion by directing us to the end for which theſe things were given us, teaches us <hi>to uſe the World, ſo as not to abuſe it;</hi> to extract the Sweets out of all ſublunary Enjoyments, without incurring the danger of that Sting, which Exceſs and Debauchery leave behind them: It makes our Pleaſures durable and laſting, by teaching us the rational Enjoyment of the good things of this World, and denies us nothing which is pleaſing and diverting, but what is alſo extravagant and brutiſh. It alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Frees us from all thoſe things which ſour the Enjoyments of Life; rooting out all irregular Paſſions, ſuch as Envy, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Malice, and Revenge; and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our Minds to a calm and even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; diverting our Affections from things below, and ſetting them on things above:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103240:13"/>It ſtifles the firſt riſing of our inordinate Deſires, and teaches us to lead our Lives peaceably, ſoberly, and moderately, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that we live under the Eye of a Holy and All-ſeeing God. The fear of God will reſtrain the violence, and impetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Paſſions, and eſtabliſh us in a juſt Empire over our ſelves, and bring our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Faculties under the Dominion of Reaſon: the Love of God will produce in us a Love to all Mankind, as well E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies as Friends, and from hence will proceed the moſt generous and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Charity: the Senſe of our own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sinfulneſs, will keep us meek and humble, and inclinable to forgive others, <hi>Even as God for Chriſt's ſake has forgiven us.</hi> Whereas a wicked Man is like <hi>the troubled Sea which cannot reſt, but by reaſon of its being toſſed to and fro,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57, 20.</note> 
               <hi>is continually caſting up mire and dirt;</hi> Nay, he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rack'd with contrary Paſſions at the ſame time, and what was the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Catiline, Alieni appetens, ſui profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> may be the Character of many a wicked Man: he is covetous, but yet a lover of expenſive Vices; ambitious and Vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and yet too proud to court popular Applauſe; quarrelſome and revengeful, but fearful and cowardly withal. Thus different Paſſions render his Life uneaſie to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103240:13"/>him, and contrary Vices (like the Poets Deſcription of the four Winds blowing in a Storm) rage all at once, and Shipwrack the Comfort and Happineſs of his Soul. And as the Paſſions of the good Man are calm, ſo is his Conſcience clear: He has none of thoſe Laſhes and Girds, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Quiet and Repoſe of every wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man: He has already accounted with the great Lord and Judge of the world, for his Sins and Imperfections; and ſince his Mind cannot charge him with any thing he has not repented of, he muſt needs <hi>have Confidence towards God.</hi> And by conſequence he is free from the dread of Death, and a future Judgment: Which take away the Comfort of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Condition; for when Men live in a ſtate of Guilt, the dread of Puniſhment will follow them; <hi>tantum metuunt, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nocent</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca</hi>) and the fear of Death and future Torments, will make them all their Life-time ſubject unto Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. It made the knees of a <hi>Belſhazar</hi> ſmite together, when he ſaw the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the Wall; and 'twould damp the Mirth of the moſt Atheiſtical Epicure, if he knew a naked Sword hung over his Head, ready to drop down upon him. Men may talk big when their Blood is hot, and in the heighth of a debauch
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103240:14"/>Laugh at thoſe ſuperſtitious Fools, who are ſcar'd with the Bug-bears of Hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but this is ſeldom the Subject of a morning thought: Do but uſe them as you do other Madmen, and keep them for ſome time in the dark, and they will ſoon regain the uſe of their Reaſon. 'Tis the peculiar Privilege of a good Man to be void of Fear: <hi>The wicked flee when no man purſues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.1.</note> 
               <hi>but the righteous is as bold as a Lyon;</hi> he only is prepar'd againſt the fears of Death, and terrors of an Eternity, and chearfully reſigns up his Breath into the hands of him who gave it: He looks upon Death (that King of Terrors to the wicked) as <hi>a Meſſenger of Peace,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from the Priſon of his Body, and opens the Gate for him into Bliſs and Immortality. Of this happy and eaſie departure out of this World, we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtances in the Holy Scripture, in whom we may conſider the Power and Vertue of a good Conſcience; which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to lie down in their Graves, with the ſame quiet and compoſedneſs of Mind, they us'd to lie down in their Beds. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe,</hi>

            <p>But here I expect it will be objected, that I have conceal'd the Difficulties which attend a Holy and religious Courſe of Life; that it is a State directly oppoſite to our vicious Appetites and Inclinations, and therefore very uneaſie to Fleſh and Blood; that it enjoyns the unwelcome Duties of Mortification, Self-denial, and taking up the Croſs; that the Ordinances of Religion are tireſome and a wearineſs to the Fleſh; that the Holy Scripture tells us,
<note place="margin">Acts 14.22. Heb. 12.6.</note> That <hi>thro' much tribulation we muſt enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; That thoſe whom God loves he chaſtneth,</hi> and <hi>That ſtraight is the Gate,</hi>

               <hi>and narrow is the way that leads to Heaven and eternal Happineſs.</hi> And if ſo, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it cannot be ſo happy and pleaſant a State of Life as I have repreſented it. To which I ſhall briefly Anſwer,</p>
            <p>That many of thoſe Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which ſpeak of the Difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a religious Courſe of Life are to be underſtood of thoſe times, when the Chriſtian Religion was perſecuted by the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103240:15"/>Heathen Emperors of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it in danger of loſing their Lives for the Teſtimony of the Goſpel. It muſt be confeſs'd, That even in our Times (when Kings <hi>are become the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers of the Church</hi>) thoſe Perſons who have been long habituated to a ſinful and wicked Courſe of Life, will find it a very difficult matter to forſake it, and to give themſelves entirely up to obey the Commands of God, and the Duties of the Chriſtian Religion: But yet it may be a mighty Incouragement to conſider, That 'tis only the firſt Entrance on a religious Courſe of Life, which is attended with ſo great Difficulty; that it will become every day more and more eaſie, and at laſt pleaſant and delightful to them. When they have for ſome time accuſtom'd themſelves to it, the Comforts of a well-ſpent Life will flow in upon them, and nothing will yield them greater Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than to be allow'd the Privilege of pouring out the Deſires of their Souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and begging Supplies from him, and returning him thanks for his Bleſſings beſtow'd upon them. They will earned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire <hi>to come and appear before God, and as the Hart panteth after the water Brooks:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1.</note> 
               <hi>ſo will their Soul pant after their God and their Redeemer.</hi> But yet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103240:15"/>that there ſhould be ſome Difficulty in the leading of a good Life, that God ſhould ſee fit to make the Profeſſion of his Truth hazardous, and the Practice of their Duty chargeable: Yet what generous and Praiſe worthy undertaking can be perform'd without Pains and Diligence? All that is excellent and noble requires Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the Pains Men take makes the dear-bought Bleſſing more acceptable to them. Do they not undergo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Difficulties for things of leſſer moment, tho' their Succeſs is ſeldom anſwerable to their Expectations? Do they not compaſs Sea and Land, leave their beſt Friends, and neareſt Relations, and dig even into the very Bowels of the Earth in queſt of Wealth; tho' for the moſt part they find a Grave, where they ſeek their Treaſure? Do they not toil and ſweat, and wade thro' a Sea of Blood in purſuit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; tho' they expect no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Pains, but a Lawrel-Wreath, or the Applauſe of the People? And ſhall not Heaven and eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſerve our Care? Shall we not take as much Pains for a never fading Crown, as we do for a withering Garland? But let us ſuppoſe the greateſt Difficulties we can poſſibly imagine, in the Practice of a good and Holy Life. Suppoſe (as we are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103240:16"/>apt to fancy) that there are <hi>Lyons in our way to Heaven,</hi> Mountains which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remov'd by our natural Strength and Ability; yet even the moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evils will not fright us from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Virtue and Holineſs, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the worſt Circumſtances a good Man can be reduc'd to, are to be preferr'd before the proſperous Condition of the wicked; as will appear from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the loweſt and moſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Condition the good Man enjoys the Comfort of a quiet Mind, and the Peace of a good Conſcience, which is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Compenſation for all the Evils he can poſſibly endure in this Life. All other Evils are ſupportable, and may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by a ſtable and well reſolved Mind; <hi>The ſpirit of a man may bear his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> 
               <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> This is the only Load which is inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and is for the moſt part the Lot of the proſperous wicked Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The good Man is furniſh'd with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing Remedies, againſt all the Evils of this preſent Life: He is aſſur'd that all Afflictions ſhall be for the good of thoſe that ſerve God, and that God diſpoſes all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103240:16"/>things with the Wiſdom and Love of an indulgent Father; that the Wheels of God's Providence have an Eye within them, which always guides them to ſome wiſe end or other;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>That Gods grace will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him,</hi> and that he will propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Aſſiſtance to his Wants; ſo that if he ſhould call him out to give his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be burned, and to lay down his Life for his ſake; he will alſo give him ſtrength to undergo the fiery Tryal; and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to praiſe him in the Flames. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The good Man is aſſur'd, that the Evils he ſuffers will ſoon be at an end; that the time draws on apace when he ſhall be eas'd of all his Troubles,
<note place="margin">Rev. 7.17.</note> 
               <hi>Have all tears wiped away from his Eyes,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Hundred fold for all thoſe momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Afflictions, he has undergone in this Life. Whilſt he endures the Croſs, his Faith ſhews him the Crown of Glory hanging over his head; and the lively Hopes of it, make him not only patient, but thankful for, and chearful under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. And I am perſwaded that St. <hi>Paul</hi> when in Chains, and under all his Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Perſecutions, was infinitely more contented than <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> than any of the moſt fortunate Princes, or wiſeſt Philoſophers amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103240:17"/>
            <p>From theſe and ſuch like Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I think it is ſufficiently evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is very little true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be found in a debauch'd and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courſe of Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the way to lead a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life even in this World, is to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the worſt Circumſtances a good Man can fall into, are to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt proſperous Condition of the wicked.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then from hence we may reaſonably conclude: That Godlineſs has the Promiſes of the Life, that now is, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> That our Happineſs in this World is beſt ſecur'd, by leading a Holy and religious Life. It only remains; that I ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Holy and religious Life fits and prepares us for everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world to come. And this is evident, becauſe a State of Grace, and a State of Glory only differ in degree; Grace is Glory begun; and Glory is Grace perfected and conſummated: So that every good Action and religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we perform, is a ſtep towards our everlaſting Happineſs, it both qualifies us for it, and leads us nearer to it; for by a Holy and religious Life, we Copy out
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103240:17"/>the Perfections of the Divine Nature, and become more like God, and the nearer we reſemble him, the more we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of him; in which the Happineſs of our future State doth conſiſt. 'Tis a State of perfect Purity and Holineſs, and conſiſts in repeated Acts of Love, and Zeal, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and therefore the better fitted, and prepar'd we are in this World, by furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Souls with vertuous Habits, and thoſe Divine Qualities of Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more capable we ſhall be of partaking of thoſe heavenly Pleaſures,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note> 
               <hi>Which are at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi> Our time in this World was given us for this very Purpoſe, that we might furniſh our ſelves with ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces (thoſe wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) which will render us fit Gueſts for the Marriage of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>'Twas eaſie for me to demonſtrate that every Vertue has an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our future Happineſs, and is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualification, which we muſt obtain before we are capable of enjoying it: but this would take up too much time at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Scot <hi>in his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life.</hi> Part. 1.</note> and has been already largely treated on by an excellent hand. I ſhall therefore only remark, That nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than to frame a Notion of our future State, from the Pleaſures and Delights of our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103240:18"/>preſent Condition: Or, to take thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Deſcriptions of it, which we meet with in the Holy Scripture in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sence. Our Saviour Chriſt has plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told us, That in Heaven <hi>we ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 12.25.</note> 
               <hi>nor marry, nor be given in marriage:</hi> A ſenſual Paradiſe might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected by a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pagan;</hi> but not by a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> whoſe Religion teaches him to Crucifie the Fleſh with the ſinful Luſts and Deſires of the ſame. It permits him indeed the moderate uſe of the good things of this World, to render his Pilgrimage more eaſie, and his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Heaven more comfortable: But yet it teaches him, that his chief Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought not to be plac'd in tranſitory Delights; that they are Joys of a more Sublime Nature, <hi>Such as neither eye hath ſeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>nor ear heard, neither hath it enter'd into the heart of man to underſtand, which God hath prepared for thoſe who love and ſerve him;</hi> ſuch Bleſſings as are agreeable to our immortal part, ſuch as the bleſſed Society of Saints and Angels, and the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, the Viſion of God; in which, our Souls (being transform'd into his Image) will be continually delighted and tranſported, in admiring and adoring the Perfections of their Creator.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103240:18"/>
            <p>If therefore we hope to be Happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> we muſt practiſe Holineſs in this Life, <hi>For without Holineſs no man can ſee God.</hi> We muſt make it the buſineſs of our Lives, to keep our Paſſions within their due Bounds, and under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Reaſon; to mortifie our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Appetites, and exerciſe our Graces; ſuch as Faith, Hope, Patience and Charity: This is that <hi>Godlineſs which has the Promiſes of the Life that now is, and that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now what remains, but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who hears me this day be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to embrace this pleaſant Courſe of Life. And methinks there ſhould need no more Arguments, to prevail with you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enter upon it; ſince I have already prov'd, that it is unqueſtionably both for your temporal and eternal Intereſt. For what doth God require of you, which is not highly juſt and reaſonable? What doth he command you? <hi>But to do Juſtice, to love Mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah 6.8.</note> 
               <hi>and to walk humbly with your God, (i. e.)</hi> to live up to the Dignity of your Natures, and to Act as becomes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and dependent Beings. Conſider what can you wiſh for, which is not to be obtain'd by obſerving the Precepts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Length of days are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103240:19"/>ſhe ſhall give thy head an ornament of Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pror. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>and a Crown of Glory. Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee, and bring thee to Honour, it ſhall be an Ornament of Grace to thy head, and as a Chain about thy neck.</hi> What Allurement can there be in the Pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a Seaſon, and periſh even in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; that you ſhould prefer them before thoſe which flow from a vertuous and religious Life?</p>
            <p>And now, may not God juſtly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate with us, as he did with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>What could I have done to my Vineyard, which I have not done unto it?</hi> What more probable, and more rational Methods could God have taken to perſwade us to be Good, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Happy, than he has made uſe of? He has addreſs'd himſelf both to our Hopes and Fears, he has plac'd eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on one hand, and eternal Miſery on the other: And moreover has ſtrow'd our way to Heaven with the good things of this Life. And now if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that God has done for us we reſolve to be miſerable, and to take even Hell by force; we have nothing to blame, but our own ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Folly. We can't ſure be ſo ſilly as to imagine, that God reaps any benefit by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103240:19"/>our Service; or that our Praiſes make any addition to his Glory,
<note place="margin">Job 35.6.</note> for as <hi>Elihu</hi> very well argues. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him, or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiply'd, what doſt thou unto him? if thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him, or what receiveth he at thy hand? thy wickedneſs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs may profit the ſon of man.</hi> And therefore 'tis evident, that 'tis only our Welfare God ſeeks, 'tis our Good he is ſo ſollicitous for; and as he made us at firſt, with a Deſign to communicate Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs unto us, ſo he ſtill retains the ſame gracious Intentions towards us. And ſhall not we be wiſe for our ſelves? Shall we willfully and obſtinately go on to defeat all the gracious Purpoſes of his Mercy and Goodneſs, to trample under feet the Blood of his dear Son, and grieve his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? Shall not theſe Cords of a Man be able to move us? Shall neither our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, nor our temporal Intereſt have any influence upon us? This would certainly be ſuch unaccountable Folly, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Ingratitude, as no conſidering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be Guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let me therefore beſeech you by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
               <hi>that you preſent your Bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is but your reaſonable Service:</hi> Let me beg
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103240:20"/>and entreat of you, in the name, and for the ſake, of your bleſſed Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that you would ſo far conſult your own Intereſt, as to lead a pure, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and devout Life; which is the only way to paſs your time chearfully, and comfortably in this World: And to make ſure of everlaſting Happineſs in the world to come.</p>

            <p>THERE is nothing which with greater Reaſon hath excited the Admiration of <hi>conſiderate</hi> Men, than the ill Entertainment which Religion and its Profeſſors have found in the World: For its Precepts are ſo rational, ſo eaſie, ſo much for the good of Mankind in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Contentment, and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of every particular Perſon, even in this World, that they would be every wiſe Man's Choice, were they not his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And yet, beſides the internal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conveniency of thoſe Commands, God has been pleas'd to lay upon us, he has inforc'd them with many powerful Motives; he has denounc'd many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Puniſhments againſt thoſe Perſons who diſobey them; Puniſhments ſo intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they are not to be conceiv'd, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103240:21"/>by thoſe who muſt undergo them: He has propos'd many excellent Rewards to thoſe who comply with them; ſuch <hi>as neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> Theſe things being duly <hi>weigh'd and conſider'd,</hi> one would think the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion could not miſs of a candid Reception; but that all Men to whom theſe <hi>joyful Tidings</hi> came would ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Proſelytes; and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to be Men, (<hi>i. e.</hi> reaſonable and thoughtful Beings) and not be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>And yet our Experience convinces us to the contrary; 'tis viſible to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Obſerver, that Piety decays, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion grows cold in our Age, and thoſe who live under the beſt Laws, are moſt tainted with Vice, and moſt diſſolute in their Manners. There are many indeed who are entred into the Church of Chriſt by Baptiſm, who wear his Badge, and make profeſſion of his Religion; but there are few, very few, who obey his Commands, and live by thoſe Rules he has laid down in his Holy Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt the many Cauſes which concur to produce this ſtrange Effect, there is none which is aſſign'd with more appearance of Reaſon, than the want of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103240:21"/>Conſideration, that general Stupidity, and careleſs Temper which has ſeiz'd the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Mankind. Moſt Men are ſo taken up with the earneſt purſuit after Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honours, or Pleaſures; with the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their Callings, and the Cares of this Life; that they ſeldom think of a Life to come, or conſider what their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be hereafter: Nay, the very thoughts of their Mortality, and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that they muſt ſhortly leave this World, ſeem as unwelcome to them, as Death it ſelf; for <hi>did we but frequently and ſeriouſly think on our ways, we ſhould turn our feet unto God's Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which words I ſhall endeavour to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is meant by <hi>thinking on our Ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What the Conſequences would be of a due performance of this Duty: <hi>We ſhould turn our feet unto God's Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is meant by <hi>thinking on our Ways. Way</hi> is a Metaphor very often made uſe of in the Holy Scripture, to ſignifie the whole Courſe of a Mans Life: The time of our continuance in this World, is very fitly ſet out by a Journey or Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103240:22"/>'tis begun at our Birth, and every moment which paſſes afterwards, is as it were a ſtep which brings us nearer our Long-home.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Thinking on our ways</hi> may be meant, Either, 1. A comparing a vertuous and religious Courſe of Life, with a vicious and debauch'd one; a conſidering what Pleaſures and Conveniencies each of them affords, what Effects they produce, and a determining within our ſelves, whether 'tis beſt and moſt for our Intereſt, to take up with the Pleaſures and Advantages, the Pomps and Vanities of the world; or to live an honeſt, ſober, and devout Life, tho' attended with many Troubles and Afflictions, and expos'd to many Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but this has been the Subject of a former Diſcourſe:
<note place="margin">Sermon the Firſt.</note> Or elſe, 2. The <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our Ways</hi> may denote, a Reflection on our own particular Actions, a Calling our ſelves to a ſtrict Account, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining our Conſciences; whether we have liv'd up to the Rule of God's word, and from thence concluding, what the preſent State of our Soul is, and what Expectations we may reaſonably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, of being Happy hereafter.</p>
            <p>And if we take theſe Words of my Text, <hi>I thought on my Ways,</hi> in this laſt Sence, then they imply theſe three things.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103240:22"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A ſetting apart ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect our ſelves, and to conſider what the paſt Actions of our Lives have been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A comparing our Actions with the Rule of God's word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A ſerious Reſolution to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in that which is good, and to reform what is amiſs.</p>
            <p>And that we may be prevail'd with to put theſe things in Practice, and perform them with the better Succeſs, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">I. How neceſſary 'tis for every one, who deſigns to lead a Holy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life, thus to <hi>conſider his ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall ſhew, after what manner we ought to perform this Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What excellent Effects a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it would have upon our Lives and Converſations. We ſhould <hi>turn our feet unto God's Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How neceſſary 'tis for every one, who deſigns to lead a Holy and Religious Life, <hi>to conſider his Ways.</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103240:23"/>coſt, whether he hath ſufficient to finiſh it?

Or, What King going to make War againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him, that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand; or elſe whilſt the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an Embaſſage, and deſireth Conditions of Peace. So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not all that he has, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> The meaning of both theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles is this: That every one who intends to be Chriſt's Diſciple, muſt firſt ſit down and conſider with himſelf, what 'tis to be a Chriſtian, what Difficulties he is like to meet with in his Chriſtian Race, what Temptations he muſt encounter withal: And if he doth not ſincerely Purpoſe to forego every thing which ſtands in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with Chriſt and his Goſpel, if he doth not reſolve to part with all that he has, rather than deny his Saviour, he can never be Chriſt's true Diſciple.</p>

            <p n="2">2. From <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Common Senſe and Reaſon will inform us, that if we deſign to direct our Lives by the word of God, we muſt frequently compare them with this Rule: We muſt reflect upon our Actions, and conſider, when we have done our Duty and acted as becomes us, and when we have tranſgreſs'd the Commands of God. For in the firſt place, the beſt Men in the world are ſubject to many ſinful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and tho' they make never ſo ſtrong Reſolutions, tho' they could ſet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their Souls in the moſt exact
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103240:24"/>Order, yet when they go abroad into the World, they will meet with ſomething or other which will ruffle and diſcompoſe them, and betray them into diſorderly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſinful Practices. There is no Man in the world ſo good and perfect, but he has his Failings, his Weakneſſes, and Infirmities: And the Devil will be ſure to aſſault him on that ſide, where he lies moſt open to Temptation, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevail againſt him: And therefore the wiſeſt Courſe a good Man can take, is frequently to recollect himſelf, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, when and where he has done amiſs, what was the occaſion of it, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him into that ſinful and fooliſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and having diſcover'd this, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to repent of his Sin, to fence and guard himſelf againſt it for the time to come, and to reſolve ſtedfaſtly, never to ſuffer himſelf to be impos'd on and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded again, in the like manner.</p>
            <p>In the next place there are many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which at firſt ſight appear to us, good and Praiſe-worthy; which when more narrowly conſider'd, and try'd by the Rule of God's word, are found to be crooked and deform'd, ſuch as we have juſt cauſe to repent of. We place them at firſt in a wrong Light, we behold them thro' a falſe <hi>Medium:</hi> Our Kindneſs and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103240:25"/>toward them, makes them ſeem of a different Complexion than they are really of: But when we come to conſider them without Paſſion or Prejudice, to weigh every Circumſtance; Then 'tis plainly evident, that we admire our ſelves for Qualities which are not in us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud our ſelves for Actions which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: We perform'd them either out of a wrong End, or they proceeded from a falſe Principle, or we were defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the Manner of tranſacting them: So neceſſary is it to <hi>conſider our Ways,</hi> and to bring our Actions, to the Touch-ſtone of God's word; even thoſe Actions which we eſteem moſt Holy and Perfect. For our Righteouſneſſes, the moſt regular Acts of our Lives, our moſt Affectionate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Devotions, are ſtain'd with Sin; and want that Purity and Integrity, which God requires in them; they are deriv'd either from Self-love, or Pride, or deſire of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or love of Gain, from fear of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or diſcredit in the World; rather than out of Love and Reverence, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards God; Charity and Good-will towards our Neighbour; or a ſober regard to our own true Welfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And though God has Promiſed to pardon thoſe Sins, and to paſs by that Obliquity of our Actions, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103240:25"/>from the frailty and infirmity of our Natures; yet he expects that we ſhould repent of them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> That we ſhould confeſs and forſake them, expreſs our Sorrow for what we have done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to Act better for the future, which can never be perform'd without a ſevere Examination of our Hearts, and calling our ſelves to a particular Account; how and wherein we have offended.</p>
            <p>But farther; the abſolute neceſſity of Examining our ſelves, will appear from this Conſideration; That the greateſt part of our time is ſpent amidſt the noiſe and hurry of the World; our Thoughts are taken up chiefly in the buſineſs of our Callings, in providing for our Families which is ſo far from being a Fault, that 'tis highly commendable and Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (for God is better pleas'd with a Man, who is diligent and induſtrious in that Calling and Station he has plac'd him in, than he would be, if he were continually upon his knees, performing one uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Act of Devotion; and this I am induc'd to believe, for this one plain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe all the Devotional parts of our Religion were chiefly intended, to help and aſſiſt us, in the Practice of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God requires of us in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations.) But yet, ſeeing ſo much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103240:26"/>of our time is ſpent in the buſineſs of this Life, ſo many of our thoughts taken up with our worldly Affairs, we muſt needs judge it highly reaſonable that we ſhould ſet apart ſome time to retire into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of our Breaſt, and frequently conſider what State and Condition our better and more Spiritual part is in; what Sins we have been guilty of; and whether we go forward or backward in the Ways of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion. Every prudent Man, and good Husband, doth this in his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Concerns, he that deſigns either to keep or encreaſe his Eſtate, makes it his firſt and chiefeſt Care, to be exact in keeping his Accounts, to Balance them often, and to inform himſelf what proportion his Incomes bear with his Expences: And thus careful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent we ſhould be in our ſpiritual Affairs, if we had but the ſame Value for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, which we have for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Goods of this World; this would ſuperſede my Labour of proving to you, the abſolute and indiſpenſable neceſſity, which lies upon every one to continue in the Practice of this Duty.</p>
            <p>And in truth, this has been the uſage of good and vertuous Men in all Ages of the world; not only of thoſe whoſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are recommended to our Imitation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103240:26"/>in the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> but alſo of thoſe Heathens, who have been eminent for Vertue and Morality. The Pſalmiſt tells us,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.6.</note> That he us'd conſtantly to call himſelf to an Account. <hi>I call to remembrance my ſong in the night, I commune with my own heart, and my ſpirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> Amongſt the Fathers of the Primitive Church, we find all thoſe who wrote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on practical Subjects preſſing this Duty of Self-examination: The time would fail me, ſhould I inſtance in the Precepts of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Baſil, Gregory</hi> and the reſt. Neither were the Heathen Moraliſts wanting in the recommendation of it, both by Precept and their own Examples: That Precept of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in his golden Verſes is generally known.</p>

               </gap>. Ask thy ſelf (ſays he) every Night, What Sin have I committed this day? What Good have I done? What Good have I left undone, which I ought to have done? <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, <hi>Quotidie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud me cauſam dico,</hi> I every day paſs Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon my own Actions: when I am in Bed, and the Light is taken away, I run over all my Words and Deeds, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how I have ſpent that day, I omit nothing which I can recollect; for why ſhould I be afraid to reflect on my own
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103240:27"/>Failings, when I can ſay to my ſelf, this was not well done, but do ſo no more? He alſo tells us of his Friend <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, who duly thus examin'd himſelf, before he went to reſt: What Diſeaſe of thy Soul, or what Vice haſt thou cur'd this day? What Sin haſt thou ſubdu'd? Art thou a better Man to day, than thou waſt yeſterday? If ſo, thou haſt liv'd to ſome Purpoſe; but if not, thou haſt but conſum'd and loſt thy time. And to name no more, the Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> when he ſaw any Man do a wicked or unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Action, us'd to ask himſelf this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; have I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been guilty of this Crime? If this Sin looks ſo ill in that Man, is it not worſe in me? If I have never been guilty of it, let me be ſure to avoid it for the time to come.</p>
            <p>I might eaſily heap up many like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for this has been the Practice of good and vertuous Men in all Ages; and in truth 'tis hardly poſſible for a Man to be good and vertuous, who omits or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the Performance of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhall take this for granted: And proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To lay down ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how we may perform this Duty to the beſt advantage. And,</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103240:27"/>
            <p n="1">1. When we deſign to perform this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Self-examination, let us firſt free our Minds from all the Cares and Buſineſs of Life, from every thing which will take up our Thoughts; and apply our ſelves to this Task with ſeriouſneſs and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For ſince the Intereſts of this World, and the next are widely different, it will be impoſſible to attend on the one, whilſt our Thoughts are taken up about the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And we may as well fix our Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two oppoſite Objects at the ſame time, as keep our apprehenſive Faculty intent both on Things temporal, and Things ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>When we have cleans'd and purg'd our Souls, from all carnal and worldly Thoughts, and Affections; let us beſeech God, from whom are <hi>the Preparations of the heart,</hi> that he will enable us impartially to examin and ſearch into our own Souls; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our Underſtandings, aſſiſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and diſcover to us thoſe Sins which lie hid in our Conſciences, and <hi>teach us thoſe things we know not;</hi> which either we never took notice of, or which we have forgot: That we may have the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of them at preſent, we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be affected with, when we come to lie upon a Sick-bed, and to have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other World.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:103240:28"/>
            <p>Having thus fitted and prepared our ſelves, let us conſider how, and after what manner we muſt Examine our ſelves: And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The time when we ought to employ our ſelves about this Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">II. What ought to be the Subject of our Examination. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the time when this Duty will be moſt ſeaſonably perform'd, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made it appear, That it has been the Practice of good Men in all Ages, to examine themſelves daily; and this with very good Reaſon: For ſince Confeſſion of Sin is one Condition, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, before he will Seal the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins, 'tis impoſſible we ſhould make a full and particular Confeſſion of them, unleſs we examine our ſelves daily. The number of our Sins is ſo great, that ſhould we defer it till a farther time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would ſlip out of our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and then God has reveal'd to us, no other Condition of Pardon, but that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion of them,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.12.</note> 
               <hi>cleanſe thou me from my ſecret Sins;</hi> and how can we call thoſe Sins <hi>ſecret,</hi> which are conceal'd from us, only becauſe we will not take the Pains to diſcover them?</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:103240:28"/>
            <p>What time of the day is moſt proper for this Employment, every Man's Prudence muſt determine, this muſt be directed by the Exigency of his Affairs: but for the moſt part it will be requiſite even in this Caſe,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.6.</note> to follow the Advice of the wiſe Man, <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand.</hi> To conſider in the Morning, what Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we are like to meet with that day, what opportunities of doing good, and making the moſt ſtrong and firm Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we will reſiſt the one, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the other: And to call our ſelves to account in the Evening, how well we have put theſe Reſolutions into Execution, whether <hi>we have perform'd our vows unto God,</hi> or elſe ſhamefully given up his Cauſe, and yielded to the importunity of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Temptation.</p>
            <p>But beſides this daily Examination of our ſelves, there are other times when we ought to call our ſelves to an Account: 'Tis the great Duty of the Lord's Day; A Day ſet apart on purpoſe, that thoſe Perſons who all the week long are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with the Cares of this world, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Buſineſs of their Callings, and in making proviſion for their Bodies, might have ſome time to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſecure the eternal Welfare
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103240:29"/>of their Souls. And how can Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this day better? (I mean that part of it, when they are not call'd upon to joyn in the publick Offices of Religion) than in recollecting themſelves, how they have ſpent the week paſt, what Sins they have been guilty of, what good Actions they have perform'd, what Progreſs they have made in a holy and vertuous Life; and in conſidering what Temptations they are like to be expos'd to the following Week, and in taking up Reſolutions of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſtrictly and more circumſpectly; and that by the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, they will yield a more exact obedience to his Commands. This ought to be the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of every Lord's Day, and every Day hallowed and ſet apart for the Worſhip of God; but more particularly of thoſe times, when we intend to prepare our ſelves for the receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper: Then it behoves us to make a more <hi>diligent ſearch</hi> into our Lives and Converſations, that we retain no <hi>Leaven of Malice and Hypocriſie,</hi> no evil thing unrepented of, which may deprive us of the Benefits of this bleſſed Ordinance. Next to the time, let us conſider:</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Subject of our Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And here let us make an exact Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into all the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103240:29"/>of our Hearts, the words of our Lips, and the Actions of our Lives. Concerning our thoughts, let us ask our ſelves ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as theſe. What is it that I moſt think upon? Are my Thoughts ſerious, ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pure? Are my Inclinations compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with God's Law? What doth moſt eaſily ſtir me, and how is my heart moved? Are my Affections calm, and orderly, and well plac'd? What Plots do I contrive? What Projects am I driving on? Are my Deſigns good? Are my Intentions upright and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere? Concerning our Words, let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thus.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note> Have I learn'd <hi>to keep my tongue as it were with a bridle,</hi> to refrain from all manner of evil Speeches, and to imploy it to that uſe for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to glorifie God, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Thoughts of our hearts one to another? As to our Actions; let us firſt enquire, whether they are good and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rule of God's Word; and then let us reaſon thus with our ſelves: This Action was indeed well done, but might I not have done better? might I not have brought more Glory to God, and procur'd more good for my Neighbour? Was not this good Action imperfect as to ſome Particulars? Was I not too blame as to ſome Circumſtances? And if ſo, let us reſolve, That if ever God puts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103240:30"/>opportunity into our hands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame Action again, we will mend theſe Defects, and be wiſer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the future: But on the other hand, if upon comparing our Actions, with the Rule of God's word, we find they have been evil and diſagreeable to it; then let us ſay thus to our ſelves, I have done this wicked Act, and hereby offended my good God; but what benefit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage have I got for my ſelf? Doth not that trouble and remorſe of Conſcience which I feel for the Commiſſion of this ſin, much exceed the Pleaſure I took in it? Is it not a very fooliſh thing to purchaſe ſo little, ſo momentary a Pleaſure, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Quiet and Repoſe of my Mind, a good Conſcience here, and eternal Happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>And that we may have a true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſe of the evil Nature of our Sins, let us conſider the ſeveral aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which attend them: Perhaps the Crime which we committed was done with Deliberation; perhaps in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to the Checks of our Conſcience, and the bleſſed Motions of God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; perhaps it has been frequently repeated, and we ſtill continue to go on in it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Calls to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the many Vows and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103240:30"/>we have made of leaving and forſaking it. Theſe and many more are the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Circumſtances, whereby our Sins are render'd more heinous, and <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful.</hi> Thus the Treaſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was a Sin of the deeper die, becauſe he was one of Chriſt's <hi>familiar Friends and Diſciples,</hi> who convers'd with him, and did <hi>eat of his Bread:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry did offend God the more, becauſe <hi>his heart was turned from the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 11.9.</note> 
               <hi>who appeared unto him twice, and had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him concerning this very thing, that he ſhould not go aſtray after other Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſteps by which we ought to proceed in the Examination of our ſelves: Which when we have perform'd, that we may make a right Judgment of the State of our Souls; let us take a review of what we have done, and compare our preſent Condition, with our former Courſe of Life; and then let us conſider with our ſelves, whether we grow in Grace, whether our vertuous Habits and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more rooted and confirm'd,
<note place="margin">2 Pet 1.8</note> or elſe whether we loſe ground, and <hi>become barren and unfruitful in every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here that we may not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I ſhall interpoſe one Caution; that the Standard of our improvement in holy Living, and growth in Grace, is not to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103240:31"/>be taken from the Affections: Theſe for the moſt part are moſt vigorous and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we firſt enter upon a religious Courſe of Life; we are then ſooneſt warm'd and rais'd up into Extaſies, and Raptures of Devotion; eſpecially in our tender years, when our Paſſions bear the greateſt ſway in us, and captivate our Reaſon: but as we grow in years, theſe heats languiſh and decay, and as our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Judgment improve, we are leſs Subject to theſe Tranſports of our Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and proceed in a ſteady and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Courſe of Piety and Vertue: And therefore the beſt way to make a right Judgment of our ſpiritual Improvements, is to conſider; whether we live up more exactly to the Rules of our Duty? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we yield a more ready Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel, than we have formerly done? whether we have left off any of our evil Practices, and bid adieu to our beloved Sins? whether we have brought our ſelves to ſuffer Affliction pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, to reſign up our Wills to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will more contentedly? Theſe are the moſt certain Signs by which we may beſt judge of our Improvements in Grace.</p>
            <p>And if we find that we do indeed grow better and better, then in the next place; let us endeavour to call to mind, by what
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103240:31"/>means we have made theſe Improvements: What Motives and Inducements moſt wrought upon us: What Rules and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were moſt uſeful: What Company and examples were moſt alluring:
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>And then let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame things.</hi> But if on the other hand we find that we decline in Vertue and Piety, that our Sins (thoſe Sons of <hi>Anak</hi>) have been too hard for us, and that we have been guilty of many hainous and preſumptuous Crimes; then let us careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh and conſider, what it was which betray'd us into theſe Sins; how we came to be prevail'd with, to do ſuch fooliſh and unreaſonable Actions; Actions which are both diſpleaſing to God, and unbecoming the Dignity of our Natures, and that rank of Being which we hold in the world; by what means and methods did the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (that old Serpent) wind himſelf into our Souls? with what bait did he allure us? under what ſpecious ſhews did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his Temptations? which was our weak ſide that firſt yielded to the Aſſault? what were the occaſions and inducements of our falling into Sin? And when we have found out theſe, let us make ſolemn Vows and Reſolutions, that for the time to come we will be more vigilant and watchful, that we will <hi>reſiſt the Devil,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103240:32"/>and then he will flee from us,</hi> and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>return to folly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4.7. Eph. 6.11.</note> But that we will take to our ſelves <hi>the whole Armour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, wherewith we ſhall be enabled to ſtand in the day of Tryal, and remain Chriſt's faithful Souldiers and Servants to our Lives end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to conclude all, let us beg of God, to give us his Grace and Aſſiſtance, that we may do ſo. And if we thus pray, and thus do; then we ſhall certainly reap thoſe bleſſed Fruits and Effects, which will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from a due performance of this Duty; <hi>We ſhall turn our feet unto God's Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhew what theſe Fruits and Effects are, is the Third and laſt Head I propoſe to Diſcourſe upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A due Examination of our ſelves would keep our Conſciences tender. 'Tis morally impoſſible for a Man to go on in the habitual Practice of any known Sin, who daily calls himſelf to Account for his Actions; who diſtinctly and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders in what Particulars he has offended God, and what has been the Effect and Conſequence of doing ſo: For Vice is in it ſelf ſo ugly and deformed, ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to our true Intereſt, even in this Life; and Vertue ſo lovely and amiable, that no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103240:32"/>Man who ſees them both barefac'd, but muſt needs hate and deteſt the firſt, and cloſe with, and embrace the latter. 'Tis want of Conſideration which betrays Men into ſinful and fooliſh Practices: When the Mind is blinded either with Paſſion or Senſuality, then it becomes a Prey to every vile Luſt: And therefore God is ſaid to come unto Men <hi>in a ſtill voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 19.12. Gen. 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>and in the cool of the day,</hi> when they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of hearkening to the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to weigh and conſider things: But the Devil appears in Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and hurries Men on into Ruin. When he has once engag'd them in any evil Practice, he will not ſuffer them to take any reſt, to ſit down and look back upon what they have done, but carries them on, from one degree of wickedneſs to another, till at laſt they have neither Will nor Power to repent. For the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at firſt is timorous and baſhful; his Conſcience is ſeiz'd with Fears and Doubts, miſ-givings and relentings, it accuſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and puniſhes him for his Crimes, and performs the part of God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his Soul, whilſt he is attentive to it, and continues to live under its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſubmits himſelf to its Diſcipline: But when he turns a deaf ear to its Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and withdraws himſelf from its
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103240:33"/>Obedience, when he is ſo much taken up with the ſpecious ſhews and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of ſenſual Pleaſure from without, that he has no leiſure to hearken to the Voice of this heavenly Monitor from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Then Sin that ſtrong Man takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Heart, Rules and Domineers there, and he is given up by degrees to hardneſs of Heart, and a reprobate Mind. Whereas were but this one Rule, <hi>Of a daily Examination of our ſelves,</hi> conſcientiouſly practis'd, Men might have ſome ſtruglings and fightings within them, their deprav'd Nature might ſometimes prevail againſt them, but they would never become ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually debauch'd;
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> in Pſal. 4.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſays the Father: That is, the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration what ſmart Men have formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd for their Sins, will make them fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of committing the ſame again: And the Thoughts that they muſt give a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy account of their Actions, not only to God in the other world, but to their own Conſciences in this, would engage them ſo to govern their Actions, that they may have no reaſon to bluſh at, or repent of them. The Pleaſure of reflecting on their good Deeds, would be a moſt powerful allurement to perſevere in well-doing;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103240:33"/>and the farther they walk in the Paths of Vertue, they will take the greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Delight in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From a daily Examination of our ſelves would flow Peace of Mind, and a comfortable perſwaſion and aſſurance, that we are in God's Favour, and under his Protection;
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>for if our Minds condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> If we have repented of our Sins, and made our Peace with God, we need not fear what Men or Devils can do unto us. Fear is generally the effect of Guilt, and a Conſciouſneſs that we deſerve Puniſhment for our evil Deeds: But when by a due Examination of our ſelves, we have ſet Accounts right between God and our Souls; when we have found out thoſe <hi>accurſed things</hi> which make God our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.33.</note> 
               <hi>and hewn theſe Amalakites in pieces before the Lord;</hi> then have we good grounds <hi>to truſt in the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay 50.10.</note> 
               <hi>and to ſtay our ſelves upon our God.</hi> And God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.3.</note> that he will <hi>keep that Man's Mind in perfect Peace, whoſe Soul is ſtayed on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A daily Examination of our ſelves will encreaſe our Charity, and incline us to entertain the moſt favourable Opinions of other Men. We ſhall eſpy ſo many, and ſo great Faults in our ſelves, that we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103240:34"/>ſhall have neither a Deſire nor leiſure to pore upon thoſe of our Neighbour; and the Conſideration how much need we have of Forgiveneſs, will render us more willing to overlook or pardon thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which are committed againſt us; and will teach us to <hi>forgive others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 11.25.</note> even as we hope, <hi>that God for Chriſt's ſake will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Self-Examination would make us truly ſenſible of God's Patience and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, who ſtill extends his Mercy and Forgiveneſs towards us, notwithſtanding our manifold and daily Provocations: He is more ready to Pardon than we are to Repent, and kindly meets and receives all ſuch as return unto him.</p>
            <p>The time would fail me, ſhould I reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate all the Benefits and bleſſed Effects, which would flow from a conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty. It would be of uſe to us at all times, and in all Conditions. It would keep us humble in Proſperity, ſupport us in Adverſity; it would enable us to ſubdue our Paſſions, and moderate our Appetites; it would take away the ſting of Death, and make our Departure out of this World eaſie and comfortable.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, it would be of excellent uſe to ſweeten the Comforts of Life to us, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103240:34"/>help us to obtain everlaſting Happineſs in the world to come.</p>
            <p>And now I think 'tis plain, <hi>That a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examining our Lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> is a Duty enjoyn'd us by God; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by Men eminent for Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, both Chriſtians and Heathens; agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Reaſon; and of admirable uſe in all the various Exigences of Life; and that moſt of the Miſ-carriages, Sins, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which we are guilty of, do proceed from the Neglect and Omiſſion of it.</p>
            <p>What then remains, but that we go and put this plain and eaſie Rule in Practiſe; and ſo <hi>think on our Ways, as to turn our feet unto God's Teſtimonies. Which God of his Mercy grant for the ſake of our bleſſed Redeemer, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103240:39"/>comport their Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they look upon ſerving God as the great Buſineſs of their Lives, and make all other things truckle and ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to it: Their firſt and principal Care, <hi>is to make ſure of the Kingdom of Heaven and its Righteouſneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.33.</note> and then they are not very ſollicitous for <hi>thoſe other things which will be added thereunto:</hi> They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a good Conſcience before all other Comforts this world can afford them, and had rather <hi>part with Father, Mother, Wife and Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10.29.</note> 
               <hi>nay their own Lives, than deny their great Lord and Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as have the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> are religious in Private, as well as in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. They who have the true Fear of God, and retain awfull Apprehenſions of his Majeſty, conſider that his All-ſeeing Eye is every where, and beholds the <hi>very intents and purpoſes of the heart.</hi> He therefore who is truly Religious, is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in his Cloſet, as he is in the Church; as conſcientious in performing his private Devotions, as in frequenting the publick Worſhip of God: He is as careful to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all unjuſt Actions (tho' he is aſſur'd they will never be diſcover'd) as he is to prevent open Violence: He will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame, back-bite, or ſo much as ſpeak an evil word againſt his Neighbour (tho' he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103240:39"/>is Morally aſſur'd it will never come to his ears:) Nay, he will not harbour the leaſt wicked Thought againſt God, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Intent againſt his Brother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believes that God, who takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all his Thoughts, Words, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, will one day <hi>call him to an Account for them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16.27.</note> 
               <hi>and either reward or puniſh him according to his Deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Man who has the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> yields an uniform and univerſal Obedience to all God's Laws; he has the ſame Reaſon for obeying one Precept, which he has for obſerving the reſt; and therefore doth not think, that his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any one part of his Duty, will attone for the neglect of the other. He doth not take up with the more eaſie Duties of Religion, or avoid only ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are burthenſome, and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, but he performs whatſoever God has Commanded him, how contrary ſoever to his temporal Intereſts, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations:
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> 
               <hi>He forſakes every evil way, and lays aſide every weight,</hi> and <hi>has reſpect unto all God's Commandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.6.</note> He doth not endeavour to reconcile God with <hi>Mammon,</hi> or by being nice and exact in performing ſome of God's Commands, to make amends, for the breach of the reſt; but he gives himſelf up to obey God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103240:40"/>any manner of Exception or Reſerve, and endeavours to ſerve him <hi>with all his Soul, with all his Heart, and with all his Strength.</hi> 'Tis true, a good Man may be guilty of ſome Sins: The weakneſs of our Nature is ſuch,
<note place="margin">Prov. 24.16.</note> That <hi>the moſt juſt Man falls ſeven times a day:</hi> But tho' he falls, yet he quickly riſes again, by a ſincere and hearty Repentance: He ſets a Watch over himſelf and reſolves to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the future: He doth not willfully and obſtinately go on in his Sins; but he is ſorry for them, he Prays and ſtrives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and by degrees he gets the Victory over them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He who has the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> is Religious through the whole Courſe of his Life, he doth not only repent of his Sins, and obey the Law of God at ſome certain Times and Seaſons, but his whole Life is regular and uniform, and he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame ſteady Courſe of Piety and Devotion. Many there are who are very Religious and Devout at ſome times, but then they let the Reins looſe at others, and think by a ſtrict Obſervation of ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to make amends for thoſe groſs Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, they allow themſelves in all the reſt of their Lives: But the truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man perſeveres to the end, in Practiſe of Piety and Holineſs: He is not indeed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103240:40"/>always equally zealous and fervent, he doth not always worſhip God with the ſame Ardency of Affections, nor is he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wrought up to the ſame pitch of Devotion: But when he is at the loweſt Ebb; he endeavours to quicken and raiſe his Affections, he begs of God to enflame his Heart with a <hi>Coal from the Altar,</hi> and cannot reſt ſatisfied till <hi>the Light of God's Countenance</hi> ſhines in upon his Soul, and he is in ſome meaſure aſſur'd of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Good-will towards him.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the four Marks by which we may certainly diſcover (if we will but bring our ſelves to the Tryal) whether we have the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> or the <hi>Form</hi> only. I come now</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. We muſt Examine their Doctrine and the Ends of it; St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us a hint of both; <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>mark them, which cauſe Diviſions and Offences</hi> (there's their Doctrine) <hi>contrary to what they

            <p n="2">II. We muſt deteſt their evil Examples; for this is an abſolute and certain Rule; that unleſs we diſlike their evil Practices, and alienate our Affections from them; we ſhall write after the ſame Copy: Our Life will be according to our liking, and therefore we muſt hate and deteſt their Hypocriſie, though we love the Men; we muſt abhor the Uglyneſs of their Vice, tho' we bear no ill will to their Perſons.

            <p>And therefore I ſhall more particularly ſet out the Bounds, and Limitations of this Precept, and conſider how far we muſt <hi>turn away</hi> from ſuch Men; as have the

Nay, we muſt not ſo <hi>turn away</hi> from any Man, as to refuſe doing good and charitable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either to his Soul or Body: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imitate the Example of our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father,

            <p>In ſhort let us obſerve theſe three Rules,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us imitate them in good things. The <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> the outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, is highly neceſſary and Praiſe-worthy. Let us therefore imitate them in this. Nay, Let us go beyond them in a conſtant attendance on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Duties of Religion, in the Devotion of our Prayers, the Solemnity of our Faſts, the becoming Decency of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and in avoiding all ſuch Sins, as are not only heinous Offences againſt God, but ſcandalous amongſt Men, and uneaſie to modeſt and vertuous Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Let that Face and outſide of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they put on, incite in us a Holy Emulation, to outdo them in their own Art: For good is ſtill the ſame in whatſoever Subject 'tis found; we have no Reaſon to refrain from good Works, becauſe a <hi>Papiſt</hi> hopes to merit by them: I'll learn from a <hi>Turk</hi> to die for my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to ſearch the Scriptures from a <hi>Jew.</hi> Our Saviour makes the unjuſt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's Wiſdom a Pattern for his Diſciples. The Ox and the Aſs are made uſe of to teach Men Gratitude, and the Piſmire Wiſdom. Nay, we may learn Diligence, and Care of our eternal Salvation from the Devil himſelf, <hi>Who compaſſeth the whole
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103240:43"/>Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>and walketh about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us bear with them in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, <hi>following after thoſe things which make for Peace,</hi> and where we lawfully and with a good Conſcience may, <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things to all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 8.19.</note> 
               <hi>that we may ſave ſome.</hi> In ſhort, we muſt <hi>love both Truth and Peace, (i. e.)</hi> both of them in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction one with the other. We muſt ſo love Peace, as not to loſe Truth, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſubſtantial: And ſo love Truth, as not to break Peace in matters indifferent.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let us turn away and avoid, only that which is evil in them; this is of the ſame Import with that <hi>Caveat</hi> which our Saviour gave to his Diſciples, againſt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of their Leven (i. e.)</hi> all that is ſour and infectious, which will ſpread the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and propagate the miſchief. <hi>Let us diſtinguiſh the good from the bad, the light from the darkneſs; Let the one be call'd day, and the other night;</hi> Let the one be imitated, and the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.11.</note> Let only <hi>the unfruitful works of darkneſs be rejected:</hi> But let us welcome the Light, and embrace Love, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the good, where-ever we meet with them: And if we do ſo, then <hi>Mercy and Truth ſhall meet together, Righteouſneſs and

            <p>THE <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> are a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of wiſe Sentences and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthegms, grounded upon the long Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ripe Experience of one of the moſt Potent Princes, and wiſeſt of Men: And ſince Proverbs in general are obſerv'd to contain the Wiſdom of all Nations, therefore we may reaſonably expect to find a rich Treaſure of Divine Truths, in thoſe of which <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Author, or elſe by Collection made his own. All the Books of the Old Teſtament may well be compar'd to a fruitful Soil, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103240:45"/>this of the Proverbs abounds with a more rich Vein, and is of the greater Uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contains Precepts accommodated to all the Neceſſities of humane Life; for the moſt part they have no coherence, but are ſet down juſt as they came to the Mind of the inſpired Author. The Verſe which I have read to you, is of the neareſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and ſhews us the prudent uſe which a wiſe Man makes of a friendly Reproof; and what great advantages he reaps by it. <hi>Reprove one that hath underſtanding, and he will underſtand know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> (i. e.) 'tis a Sign of a Wiſe, a Good, and an underſtanding Man to take Reproof patiently and thankfully, to give an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Ear to it, to be very quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diſcovering his own Faults, when they are laid open to him, and very diligent and induſtrious in reforming himſelf. <hi>Reprove one that hath underſtanding,</hi>

            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:103240:45"/>
            <p n="4">IV. Give ſome Rules and Directions, for a right Management of our ſelves, in the Execution of it.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the excellent Uſe which a wiſe Man makes of a friendly Reproof.
<note place="margin">Prov. 25.12.</note> 
               <hi>As an Ear-ring of Gold, and an Ornament of fine Gold, ſo is a wiſe Reprover upon an obedient Ear,</hi> which is thus Paraphras'd by a Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father of our Church. <q>A good Man will not think himſelf reproach'd, but rather oblig'd by a prudent Reproof, which meeting with an attentive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, and patient Mind, makes a Man take it ſo kindly; that he eſteems him who beſtows it, as much as if he had hung a Jewel of Gold, or put the richeſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament about his Neck.</q> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing harder to find than a true Friend; and he is the trueſt and beſt Friend, who will moſt impartially Reprove us for our Faults, ſhew us the Errors of our Lives, diſcover to us thoſe Rocks on which we ſplit, and faithfully tell us when we do amiſs; and therefore this is one way of making a Friend of an inveterate Enemy, by taking notice what fault or weakneſs he upbraids us moſt with, and accuſes us of; and thus by coming to the knowledge of our Errors, we take the firſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Amendment and Reformation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103240:46"/>of them: And if Reproof is ſo uſeful from an Enemy, how much more beneficial may it be made from a Friend? Who will both inform us when we go aſtray, and ſet us in the right Path; who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal our Faults from other Men, and yet impartially expoſe them to our own View; who knows firſt how to Lance and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Sore, and then to apply a fit Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to it. Certainly he who has got ſuch a Friend, is poſſeſs'd of an ineſtimable Treaſure, and there is requir'd only an underſtanding Mind, and a ſanctify'd Heart, to make him capable to receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by his Advice. But alas! For the moſt part Self-conceit is ſo prevalent in us, that we doat even upon our Blemiſhes and Imperfections, becauſe our own; we fall in Love with our own Pictures, tho' never ſo deform'd and ugly, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and ſurer way to diſoblige us, than by performing the moſt friendly Office in the World, the giving us a faithful Glaſs to behold our ſelves in, and ſetting our Actions in a true Light: This ſeems to be ſuch an Act of Superiority, as few Men can admit of; for tho' we muſt give the Pre-heminence to others in Riches, and Power, and the Gifts of Fortune; yet few Men are willing to believe, any one is more Wiſe, Prudent, and Diſcreet, than themſelves. And therefore,</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:103240:46"/>
            <p n="2">II. It muſt needs be a very difficult Task to perform this kind and friendly Office, and that in Reſpect either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Reprover, or 2. Of the Perſon who is to be reproved. And firſt I ſhall conſider the Difficulty of it with Reſpect to the Reprover. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Wiſe and good Man (and ſuch Perſons are only fit to Reprove others) is for the moſt part too modeſt to reprove other Men. Either he has too low and mean Opinion of himſelf and his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, or elſe he is deſirous to keep at home, and finds that a right Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Actions, is a full Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſufficient to take up all his time and thoughts; he is not willing to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with other Mens Concerns, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude himſelf into Buſineſs which doth not belong to him: Or he is ſenſible, that he himſelf is guilty of many Miſcarriages; and the Reflection on his own Infirmities, with-holds him from Reproving the Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures of other Men, who (as he is apt to think) are better than himſelf. 2. A good Man is apt to Err on the Charitable ſide, he is with Difficulty perſwaded to believe ill of his Neighbour, tho' the Crime which is charg'd upon him, is apparently and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly true. Charity will find out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excuſes, turn the beſt ſide of things,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103240:47"/>and make the moſt candid Repreſentation of his Neighbour's Actions they will bear, and in this Sence at leaſt,

               <hi>Covers a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins.</hi> 3. A good Man is apt to be too timorous: A mild and humble temper of Mind makes him fearful of diſobliging thoſe with whom he maintains a fair Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and to whom probably he may have been beholding for many good Offices, and for theſe and ſuch like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he may be very averſe, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the performance of this Duty; tho' it muſt be confeſs'd, he is much to blame for being ſo: For Difficulty is ſo far from being a juſt Excuſe for the non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty, that it is the beſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be made uſe of, to perſwade us to ſet about it more manfully and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly. <hi>Thou kneweſt that I was an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere man</hi> (ſaid the Lord to his idle and unprofitable Servant) <hi>taking up that I laid not down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19.22.</note> 
               <hi>and reaping that I did not ſow: Wherefore then gaveſt thou not my Money into the Bank; (i. e.)</hi> Since nothing but a diligent and vigorous Endeavour to ſerve God, will enable us to perform our Duty; therefore we ought to employ all our Strength and Induſtry, turn every ſtone, uſe all juſt and likely means, which will yield us any help and aſſiſtance: And ſo much the rather, becauſe the Difficulty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103240:47"/>of performing this Duty will appear ſtill greater, by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Perſon who is to be Reprov'd. For we muſt not alway expect to meet with a kind and favourable Acceptance of what we Deſign for the good of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Many Men are like thoſe Swine mentioned in the Goſpel, if we throw the Pearls of good Advice before them, they will be ſo far from thinking themſelves beholding to us, for this our kind and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Office, That <hi>they will turn again and rent us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.6.</note> We muſt expect to loſe their good Opinion and Friendſhip, and that they will <hi>become our Enemies, becauſe we tell them the Truth.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhall find that ſome Men think themſelves too great to be Reprov'd. They are indeed conſcious of their own Failings, they know that they are guilty of many ſcandalous Crimes, and groſs Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but yet they Fanſie that they may live, without any manner of Reſtraint, becauſe they are above the common Rank and Level of Mankind: They have Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the good things of this World, ſufficient to maintain them in Pomp and Grandeur, without a ſervile Dependance on any one; and therefore they look upon it as an Intrenchment on their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, to be call'd to an Account for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103240:48"/>their Words or Actions, or to be Reprov'd for their evil Deeds, tho' with never ſo much Prudence and Diſcretion, Mildneſs and Submiſſion. What is more frequent, than for Men of plentiful Fortunes, to laviſh out thoſe good Gifts of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) of which they are only the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Truſtees) in Rioting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Chambring and Wantonneſs, on this falſe Suppoſition, That they may do what they pleaſe, with what they (thro' miſtake) call their own? How many are there that fill all places, where they come with Oaths and Execrations, and the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Abuſe of God's moſt holy Name, and yet would look upon it as a great piece of Rudeneſs, Ill-breeding, and an intolerable Affront, ſhould any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for ſo doing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others there are, and thoſe of all Ranks and Degrees, who think themſelves too good to be Reprov'd. There are too many who are ſo puff'd up with a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Opinion of their own Righteouſneſs, that they make their own Words and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Standard whereby they try all Religion and Vertue; they firſt lay it down for a Rule, that that Church or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which they are Members, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true one upon Earth, they Fanſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only Elect of God, and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103240:48"/>of Heaven, and then make this falſe and dangerous Inference, That they can neither think, nor Act amiſs; for ſince they are the Elect, and precious in whom God ſees no ſin, therefore 'tis high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice for any one elſe to take any notice of their Miſcarriages. To how little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would it be to reprove a Man, that is ſo full of his own Righteouſneſs, that he thinks he has attain'd unto Perfection, and is ſo pufft up with the Contemplation of his own Performances, that he aſpires to Works of Supererogation; for to be ſo humble, as to diſclaim any Pretence to merit, and to be truly ſenſible of our own Wants, is a Qualification abſolutely neceſſary to render a Man capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving benefit by good Advice.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, moſt Men are too Wiſe to be reproved. Self-conceit is ſo natural and graceful a Vice, that all Men are more or leſs given to it,
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.5.</note> we are all apt to <hi>lean too much to our own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings;</hi> and to eſteem thoſe Opinions falſe, and thoſe Practices ridiculous, which do not exactly fall in with our Pre-conceptions, till by uſe they are render'd Cuſtomary and Familiar to us: we have a kindneſs for every thing, which carries our own Badge upon it, or has any Relation to us, and are fond of the Off-ſpring, either of our Minds or Bodies, tho' never ſo much deform'd. With what
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103240:49"/>Extenuating Circumſtances do we cloath our darling Vices, ſo that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if not like Vertues, yet more veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and excuſable? Reprove the Covetous Man for his Avarice, and he will tell you, you are miſtaken, that he is only laying up againſt a rainy Day, and wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident againſt future Contingences; and what you call Sordidneſs is only Foreſight and Frugality. Admoniſh the Prodigal and tell him, that he will ſoon ſquander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, what his more frugal Anceſtors took ſo much Care to rake together, and he will ſmile upon you, and make you this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he hates to be ſneaking and niggardly; and what you term Profuſeneſs and Luxury, he miſ-calls Liberality. You will find it a difficult Matter to perſwade the Superſtitious, that Religion doth not conſiſt in ſplendid ſhews or ritual Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: Or the blind Zealot, that whilſt he deſtroys his Brother, he doth not do God good Service: Or the giddy Enthuſiaſt, that <hi>his tongue is not touch'd with a Coal from the Altar.</hi> Mankind are generally wedded to their own Opinions, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and are more influenc'd by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cuſtom, than Reaſon; ſo that tho' they are convinc'd they are in the wrong, yet it goes againſt the Grain to confeſs, and acknowledge their Error. For Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103240:49"/>and Knowledge is the diſtinguiſhing Character of Mankind, that which renders one Man more excellent than another, and by conſequence gives the Superiority; for whoever is miſtaken muſt acknowledge, his defect in Wiſdom or Prudence, at leaſt as to that Particular, and that he was in ſome meaſure a Fool, which is the greateſt Reproach and Imputation can be caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man. For tho' 'tis the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Fall of our firſt Parents, and the Weakneſs and Corruption of our Natures, that amidſt the hurry of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs, and the many Emergencies of humane Life, the beſt and wiſeſt Man in the World is frequently guilty of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Over-ſights; yet we ſhall find few Men willing to acknowledge it, and 'tis Grace alone which by rendring us truly humble, can make us ſenſible of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and indigent Condition,
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.17.</note> and <hi>how poor, and blind, and naked we are.</hi> Theſe are the Difficulties which muſt be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr'd withal, by that Man who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to Reprove his Neighbour, which would be ſufficient to diſcourage any wiſe Man from venturing upon this Province, were he influenc'd only by prudential Principles, and temporal Inducements; but ſince God, has made it the Duty of every good Man, we may be aſſur'd,</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103240:50"/>
            <p n="3">III. That he has given us ſufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to go thro' with it, and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perform it; which are ſuch as theſe. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That much Glory will accrue to God by a faithful Diſcharge of this Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much Good-will redound to our Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We our ſelves ſhall reap much Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereby.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhall avoid thoſe Miſchiefs which the neglect of this Duty will certainly bring upon us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a faithful Diſcharge of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we ſhall bring much Glory to God; by encouraging Vertue and Goodneſs, and preventing a multitude of Sins; for the beſt way to keep out that Deluge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Profaneneſs, Looſeneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, which of late years is broke in upon us, and is like to be our Ruine, is vigorouſly and courageouſly to oppoſe our ſelves againſt the Stream, and by ſhewing our open Deteſtation and Abhorrence of it, if poſſible, to ſtem the Tide of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Vice. At ſuch a time as this, when the Calamity is grown Publick, there is no ſtanding Neuter, he that is not active and zealous in this Matter, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103240:50"/>doth not uſe his utmoſt Endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Vice and Profaneneſs, is to be deem'd a Rebel and Traytor againſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion. For when Men who profeſs, that they believe the Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt, and expect Salvation thro' his Merits, ſhall ſit ſtill and hear the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture made the Subject of the Jeſts and Drollery of prophane Men, his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ridicul'd, his holy Name diſhonoured, and not be mov'd, and tranſported againſt ſuch blaſphemous Diſcourſe, when they ſhall ſhew no open Abhorrence and Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation at unjuſt, unrighteous, or wicked Actions; they give theſe impious Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches too much Reaſon to believe, that tho' they make Profeſſion of Religion with their Mouths, yet they are ſuch Fools,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.1.</note> as <hi>to ſay in their hearts There is no God,</hi> and that they have as little true Senſe and Reverence for a ſupream Being, as themſelves. For what generous Man can be contented to ſit ſtill, and hear his beſt Friend reproach'd, and ſpoken ill off? What dutiful Son can endure, that any Aſperſions ſhould be caſt upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his Words and Actions ſhould be ridicul'd, without taking notice of, and reſenting the Affront? much more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have we to be zealous, when we hear prophane Wretches <hi>ſet their mouths againſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103240:51"/>Heaven,</hi> and blaſpheme the God that made them, and with one Breath of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, can reduce them into nothing, or into a Condition worſe than nothing. If good Men would reſent this Diſhonour done to God, and Reprove thoſe who are guilty of it, Men might be privately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they durſt not be ſo publickly Prophane; there might be many ill Men, but there would be very few ill Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Vice would be out of Countenance, and be depriv'd of its keeneſt Weapon, and moſt prevailing Argument, Faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and Imitation;
<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> and if thoſe <hi>who turn many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the Stars of the Firmament,</hi> certainly thoſe who hinder and prevent others from being wicked, ſhall not miſs of a due Reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Neighbour would receive much Benefit by a friendly Admonition. For tho' at firſt Reproof will be unwelcome and troubleſome, and he may be rather enrag'd than amended by it; yet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees a gentle Reproof will make its way, and Gain upon him, and if ever he comes to be reform'd, he will reap the Benefit of it, Peace of Conſcience, and Quiet of Mind in this Life, and everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Life to come. And who can be juſtly ſenſible, what ineſtimable benefits he confers upon his Neighbour, and what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103240:51"/>Danger, he delivers him from, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumental in his Reformation, and yet think any Pains too great to bring about this excellent Work? For ſhall wicked Men take more Pains to pervert and ruin the Souls of Men, then good Men ſhall <hi>to ſave them alive?</hi> Shall the Drunkard and Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious Perſon be more diligent to draw others into the <hi>ſame exceſs of Riot,</hi> than the Chaſte and Temperate, are to reclaim them from thoſe Vices? This would be to Diſhonour our Chriſtian Profeſſion, and publickly to own, that the Devil has more faithful Servants than our great Lord and Maſter. Let us therefore follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the bleſſed Jeſus, who made it his chief Buſineſs to reprove the World <hi>of ſin, of Righteouſneſs, and Judgment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 16.8.</note> he came upon this Errand, liv'd a Laborious Life, and dy'd a painful and ignominious Death, for this very End, that he might turn Sinners from the evil of their ways, and promote Vertue and Piety in the World. To Reprove our Neighbour is therefore the higheſt Inſtance of Charity, ſince hereby we deſign him the greateſt good Imaginable, the Happineſs both of Body and Soul. And this we ſhould be the rather prevail'd upon to attempt; ſince,</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Reproving others we may reap much Benefit and Advantage by it our ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:103240:52"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> hereby we ſhall provide our ſelves a Friend to do the ſamekind Office for us. For moſt Men are apt to recriminate, and when they are touch'd to the quick themſelves, they think to extenuate their Crimes, by finding fault with thoſe who Reprov'd them, and ſince we are all weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Creatures, and ſubject to the like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with other Men, a moſt excellent uſe may be made of ſuch Recriminations: We may hence diſcover our moſt ſecret Faults, and form an effectual Motive to amend them. For, 2. It will make us aſham'd to be guilty of thoſe Sins, which we Reprove in another; and the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that his Eye is upon us, will make us more wary in our Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and more exact in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lives and Converſations. <hi>Thou that teacheſt another</hi> (ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>teacheſt thou not thy ſelf;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.21.</note> 
               <hi>thou that preacheſt a Man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal; thou that ſayeſt a Man ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, doſt thou commit Adultery, thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacrilege?</hi> 3. We ſhall Entitle our ſelves to a bleſſed Reward, <hi>He that ſaith to the Wicked Thou art Righteous, ſhall the people Curſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24.24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Nations ſhall abhor him: but to them that rebuke him ſhall be delight, and a good Bleſſing ſhall come upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103240:52"/>
            <p>Laſtly, We ſhall hereby avoid thoſe Miſchiefs which the neglect of this Duty will certainly bring upon us. For if we do not admoniſh our Neighbour, when we ſee him commit any grievous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sin, we our ſelves are Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in his Guilt, and ſhall be accountable for it before God. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>but rather reprove them.</hi> And not to Reprove them will be accounted, <hi>to have fellowſhip with them.</hi> Theſe are ſuch weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and powerful Motives, as one would think ſhould encourage every one to the Practice of this Duty, tho' never ſo Difficult. But ſince it requires not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courage and Ability, but alſo a great meaſure of Prudence and Circumſpection to perform it aright, I ſhall in the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. and Laſt place, lay down ſome Directions for a due and prudential Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Propoſe to your ſelf a good End in Reproving others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have certain Knowledge of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Endeavour to avoid that Fault your ſelf, you reprove in others.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103240:53"/>
            <p n="4">4. Uſe the moſt inoffenſive Words, and do it after the mildeſt manner imaginable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Obſerve ſuch due Circumſtances of Time and Place; as your Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall direct.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be ſure to propoſe to your ſelf a good End in reproving others. Which muſt be the Benefit and Amendment of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be reproved. For if it appears, that the Reaſon why you reprove him, is to vent your own Paſſion, or to give way to the Reſentments of your own Mind, the Perſon reprov'd, will reap very little Benefit by it; he will look upon it as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Quarrel, proceeding from the Ill-will of his Adverſary, and rather ſeek a way how he may retaliate the Injury (as he calls it) than look into his own Breaſt, and amend his Fault. 'Tis the firſt ſtep to a Cure, to have a good Opinion of our Phyſician, which will incline us to follow his Advice, and make a due Application of his Preſcriptions: For 'tis not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a Medicine, without a proper and timely Application of it, can make it effectual. If therefore we deſire our Reproof ſhould take place, we muſt be ſure ſo to manage it, that the Perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, may look upon it as an Effect of our Love and Good-will, our ſincere
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103240:53"/>Deſire to promote his Intereſt, rather than of any Advantage, we may propoſe to our ſelves by it, or the gratifying a peeviſh and querulous Humour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us be ſure to have certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Offence, before we take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to Reprove any one. An uncertain Rumor or common Fame (which is to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a common Lyar) is not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of Reproof, much leſs a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Surmiſe, or wide Conjecture: But we muſt be morally certain of the Offence, and either Witneſſes of it our ſelves, or elſe we muſt have ſuch plain Evidence for it, (tho' not ocular Demonſtration) as no reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Man can call in Queſtion, before we believe an ill Report of our Neighbour. To yield a ready and willing Ear to Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Tale-bearing, ſhews that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are very Ill-natur'd our ſelves, or elſe very Credulous; that we want the moſt excellent of all Chriſtian Vertues, which is the very Life and Soul of Chriſtianity, I mean Love and Charity to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Is not eaſily provok'd, thinketh no evil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things; (i. e.)</hi> believeth and hopeth the beſt of every thing, and every Man. And this is a Grace ſo Eſſential to Chriſtianity, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103240:54"/>whoſoever is deſtitute of it, may make what Pretences he pleaſes to Purity, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Perfection, but he is in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Form of Chriſt's School, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the firſt Rudiments of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be ſure you your ſelf are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Fault,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> which you Reprove in others. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent Oil, which ſhall not break my head.</hi> For though 'tis the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Duty of every good Chriſtian, to <hi>ſuffer the Word of Exhortation</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, tho' from the worſt Man, and his moſt inveterate Enemy: Yet for the moſt part it ſo falls out, that the Reproof of thoſe Men, who are notoriouſly guilty of the ſame Crime, makes very little Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; we can hardly believe them in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, who blame us for the doing thoſe things which they recommend by their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; and we are very apt to conclude, that the Reaſon why they cry down the Vice, is that they may engroſs the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it to themſelves. But when a Man of known Vertue and Probity, takes upon him to Reprove, his Admonitions earty weight and Authority along with them; the Reverence which is paid to his Perſon, ſets an edge upon his Reproofs,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103240:54"/>and he doth not ſo much requeſt, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Reformation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Reproving we muſt uſe the moſt inoffenſive words, and do it after the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner imaginable. <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>if any Man be overtaken in a fault, you that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of Meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf leaſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> If his Offence proceed either from weakneſs, or inadvertency, from miſtake, or the frailty of humane Nature; the Oyl of Pity and Compaſſion, a mild and friendly Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition will ſink deeper into his Mind, and ſooner heal the wound, than a more rough and churliſh Medicine. There is indeed a time when we muſt uſe the Cauſtick, and the Corroſive, when we meet with a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and inſolent Offender: At ſuch a time as this to be cold or lukewarm is to give up the Cauſe of God, and to encourage Men in their wicked doings. We muſt ſhew our ſelves <hi>Zealous, for the Law of our God,</hi> and the Good and Welfare of our Brother: But then we muſt take Care <hi>that this Zeal be according to knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> That it be moderated and temper'd with true Chriſtian Prudence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, we ought to obſerve ſuch due Circumſtances of time, and place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as our Chriſtian Prudence ſhall direct, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103240:55"/>right Reaſon dictate to us. 'Tis the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men converſant in Buſineſs, that the Succeſs of our Undertakings depends much on our right timing of them, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in Adminiſtring Reproof. God came to <hi>Adam in the cool of the day,</hi> and the beſt time to adviſe a Man, is when he is Sedate and Calm, and at leiſure to conſider of the Counſel we give him. Every Man has his <hi>mollia tempora fandi;</hi> Seaſons when he is willing and diſpos'd to receive an Impreſſion, and the way to make our Advice ſucceſsful and profitable to him, is to lay hold on theſe Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, for as <hi>Solomon</hi> well obſerves, <hi>A word ſpoken in due ſeaſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15.23.</note>

            </epigraph>
            <p>'TIS agreed on by the whole Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Interpreters, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Pen-man of this Pſalm, ſets forth the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Effects of it, the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Salvation of all Nations; and hereby ſhews us not only how God was worſhip'd under the Law, but points out to us how he expects to be worſhip'd under the Goſpel. The beginning of this Pſalm contains an Exhortation to all the People of the World, as well Heathens as <hi>Jews,</hi> to praiſe God for that wonderful Bleſſing, of ſending a Saviour to preach
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103240:56"/>the Goſpel unto them, and revealing the Doctrine of Remiſſion of Sins; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commands his Worſhippers, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Glory among the Heathen, and his wonders among all the People, that all the Earth ſhould ſing unto the Lord, and that they ſhould ſhew forth his Salvation from day to day,</hi> ſo that their Praiſe might be as extenſive as his Benefits, and in ſome meaſure bear Proportion with his Bleſſings, which <hi>were to be ſhed upon all the Nations of the world, and to continue for ever,</hi> Ver. 1, 2, 3. In the following Verſes he infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces this Duty of praiſing God, by ſome Arguments drawn from the Conſideration of his glorious and wonderful Attributes; his Majeſty, Glory, Power, and Wiſdom; which were after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſplay'd and manifeſted in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Bleſſed Saviour, and from thence he concludes, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. That it was the Duty of all Men to frequent the place of <hi>God's Publick Worſhip,</hi> to Proſtrate themſelves before him, and to admire, reverence, and adore his Holy Name. <hi>Honour and Majeſty are before him: Strength and Beauty are in his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: Give unto the Lord Glory and Strength, give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his name, bring an Offering, and come into his Courts:</hi> And having in theſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103240:57"/>words deſcrib'd the Worſhip of God, after the manner of worſhipping him under the Law, by approaching his Temple, and bringing a Sacrifice; in the words of the Text he explains himſelf, that he doth not mean that theſe Sacrifices ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue under the Goſpel, and that thoſe who liv'd under the Reign and Kingdom of the Meſſiah, ſhould worſhip as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, but that it would be their Duty to <hi>worſhip God</hi> in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs, (i. e.)</hi> with ſuch a pure and devout Frame of Mind, ſuch ſuitable Affections, ſuch becoming, decent, and orderly Behaviour, as were typify'd and denoted to them by the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Jewiſh Law. <hi>O Worſhip the Lord in the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words we have theſe two plain Leſſons taught us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That all Chriſtians are oblig'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to meet together for the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God,</hi> ought to be perform'd in the moſt decent and ſolemn manner imaginable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all Chriſtians are oblig'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to meet together for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of God's <hi>Publick Worſhip.</hi> By Worſhip I mean, that immediate Worſhip,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103240:57"/>which is offer'd up to God in his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that <hi>Publick Acknowledgment</hi> of his Government, and Soveraignty over us, by the performance of thoſe Duties, which are enjoyn'd us in the firſt Table, ſuch as are praying to him, magnifying his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, hearing his Word, and receiving his Sacraments; which Duties are in a peculiar manner call'd the Worſhip of God, becauſe they have God for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object, they are addreſs'd to him, and terminate in him: The Will of God is the Reaſon why they are perform'd, and his Honour and Glory ought to be the ultimate End of the performance of them. So that the Worſhip here meant may be defin'd, that religious Adoration which is offer'd up unto God, in the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies</hi> of Chriſtians. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of worſhipping God in the Text, was Originally given to the <hi>Jews;</hi> but hereby was denoted and typify'd to us, that more pure and ſpiritual Worſhip, which was to ſucceed that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was to be offer'd up unto God under the Goſpel. For there is a rich Vein of Goſpel Truths, which runs through the Old Teſtament, and particularly the Book of the Pſalms, of which one of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is this Command of <hi>Worſhipping God in Publick,</hi> which is as obliging to us
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103240:58"/>Chriſtians, as ever it was to the <hi>Jews.</hi> As may be made appear from theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God has inſtituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this ſort of Worſhip: 'Tis not only a branch of the Law of Nature, but alſo a Principal part of inſtituted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion. The Light of Nature will teach us, that there is one firſt Cauſe of all things, who contains in himſelf all thoſe Perfections, in the moſt eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which he is pleas'd to communicate to inferiour Beings, and is infinitely more excellent, than the Workmanſhip of his own hands: And ſince 'tis natural for us to proportion our Eſteem and Veneration of things, according to that Worth and Dignity we apprehend to be in them, it will from hence follow, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of theſe infinite Perfections, will require and ought to raiſe, our Praiſe and Adoration. For we receive all that we have from him, and therefore we ought in the moſt ſolemn manner imaginable, to return him the <hi>Praiſe and Glory due unto his Holy Name:</hi> So that whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Excellencies of the Divine Nature in the general, or the Effects of his Goodneſs deriv'd down to us in particular; either of them will afford ſufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to oblige us to frequent the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103240:58"/>Worſhip of God.</hi> For to what end can we imagine our reaſonable Soul is plac'd in us? Why were our Bodies enlightned with this Ray of Divinity? But that we might be in a Capacity of conſidering, and contemplating the wonderful works of God's Creation and Providence. To what end have we a Power given us of communicating our Thoughts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that we might joyn together in celebrating the Praiſes of our great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? And 'tis for this Reaſon, that the Pſalmiſt calls the Tongue <hi>man's Glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57.8.</note> becauſe the firſt and chief End of our Speech, was to Praiſe and Glorifie God. From theſe and ſuch like Reflections, the generality of Vertuous and thinking Men, have given their Aſſent to this Truth; That the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, and our indiſpenſible Duty: And therefore how wide ſoever Men of different Perſwaſions are, from one another in their Way and Manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God (which proceeds from their different Notions of the Perfections of God) yet all Religions in the World centre and agree in this common Truth, and Principle, that the Worſhip of God ought to be <hi>Publick</hi> and Solemn.</p>
            <p>Publick Worſhip therefore is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of Nature, a Precept of univerſal and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103240:59"/>eternal Obligation: But beſides 'tis our declar'd Duty by poſitive Inſtitution. The <hi>Jews</hi> we know had a ſet and Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip dictated to them by God himſelf, they were under his immediate Guidance and Government, he was their God and their King too, their Civil and Religious San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were blended together, and their <hi>Worſhip</hi> ſo truly <hi>Publick,</hi> That we do not find any expreſly Commanded by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was not ſo. And this I the rather mention, becauſe 'tis on all hands agreed, that the Jewiſh Worſhip was a Type of the Chriſtian, and tho' the Ritual part of it was no longer obliging than till the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was typify'd thereby; yet all thoſe Duties which were founded upon Moral and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reaſons (as <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to be) were to continue to the end of the World. And therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells us, <hi>That he did not come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.17.</note> 
               <hi>but to fulfil it, (i. e.)</hi> he came to perform thoſe things which were repreſented by the Types and Ceremonies of the Law, which having had their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion in him, we might reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhould paſs away: But he came to confirm and eſtabliſh Moral Duties, to place them in a clearer Light, and to give Mankind juſter Notions of them, and to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103240:59"/>engage us to perform them, by more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Motives. To this end he made it his firſt and principal Care, to eſtabliſh the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God,</hi> and to refine it from its Droſs, and to reform it from all thoſe Superſtitions and Abuſes, which in a long Tract of time were crept into it: Becauſe the Purity of Divine Worſhip is the Foundation of all Religion, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Society, and the Sourſe and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all Moral Vertue. To this end our Saviour inſtituted an Evangelical Prieſthood, a particular Order of Men, inveſted with Authority to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the whole World, to offer up Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, and Thanſgivings unto God, and to unite Men into Societies, for the <hi>Publick,</hi> and more ſolemn Performance of the Duties of Religion, and to gather him a Kingdom or Church through the whole World; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> A Society of Men, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant by Baptiſm, to obey the Authority of our Saviour Chriſt, and to live by thoſe Laws, which he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and appointed in his Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>He therefore who neglects the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God</hi> (which is one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) doth in effect diſown God's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, denies his Saviour, and caſts himſelf
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103240:60"/>out of his Protection: And therefore the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly exhorts the <hi>Hebrews. Not to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.25.</note> as being one effectual Means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to <hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of their Faith,</hi> and to ſecure them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that heinous and dangerous Sin, of Apoſtatizing from the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the Nature of Divine Worſhip, it will from thence appear, that <hi>to Worſhip God Publickly,</hi> is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and our indiſpenſible Duty. For ſince Worſhip is an Acknowledgment of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and Perfections of that Being, whom we adore, 'tis evident that the more <hi>Publick</hi> this Acknowledgment is, the more perfect and acceptable is the Worſhip in the ſight of God; becauſe 'tis more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive, and anſwerable to thoſe Ends, for which he at firſt inſtituted, and deſign'd it. Now the Reaſon why we are oblig'd thus <hi>Publickly</hi> to acknowledge the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Perfections of God, is that we may hereby expreſs the Senſe of our poor, indigent, and neceſſitous Condition, and the infinite Majeſty, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; that we receive every thing we poſſeſs from this Fountain of Goodneſs, and depend on him for all that we enjoy: And therefore ſince we can make him no other Returns, we ought not to with-hold
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103240:60"/>that of a verbal Acknowledgment, and the natural Expreſſions of a grateful Mind: And ſince God is Good, not only to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us in particular, but to all the whole Race of Mankind; and ſince his moſt valuable, tho' moſt unregarded Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, are beſtow'd upon us in Common; therefore we ought to joyn together in celebrating his Praiſes, and to expreſs our Thankfulneſs with the greater Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Solemnity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the Benefits which accrue both to our ſelves and others, from the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God.</hi> We are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures naturally addicted to Imitation, and rather inclin'd to do as others do, than to take their Advice, and believe what they ſay. Example has a ſtrange influence upon us, in matters Spiritual as well as Temporal; our Paſſions are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rais'd, when by a Holy kind of Emulation, we as it were contend in the Fervency of our Devotion. For as Fire kindles Fire, and turns all other Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als into its own Nature: So a Holy and Chriſtian Zeal will produce its like in the Breaſts of all who behold it. A Man may go on a long time in the neglect of God's Worſhip in private, and too many there are, who feel little or no Remorſe in the Omiſſion of their Cloſet Devotions; but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103240:61"/>who can behold the Pious and Devout Soul proſtrate before God, repeating the Prayers of the Church with Fervency and Devotion, and a Congregation united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both in Heart and Voice, but he muſt needs be affected with it:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.3.</note> 
               <hi>While he thus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Fire will kindle in his breaſt,</hi> and he cannot forbear <hi>ſpeaking with his tongue the Praiſes of God.</hi> How often have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wicked Wretches, who came to the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God;</hi> either out of Faſhion, or Cuſtom, to look and gaze about them, or on ſome worſe Deſign, been touch'd by a Coal from the Altar? how often have their Hearts glow'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and they have taken up ſerious and Solemn Reſolutions, of ſerving and worſhipping God better for the future? And I am perſwaded were but theſe good Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſeconded, did not Men divert thoſe good Thoughts, and put them out of their Minds by Buſineſs or Pleaſure, they would not fail of having a laſting influence on their Lives and Converſations.</p>
            <p>Innumerable are the Benefits which we receive, by joyning together in the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices of Religion;</hi> which every Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Devout Perſon is ſenſible of, tho' 'tis a Difficult matter to form in others a ſutable Notion or Idea of them. Who can declare the wonderful Bleſſings which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103240:61"/>God beſtows on all ſuch as delight in his Sanctuary? Here are thoſe <hi>living waters,</hi> which allay the Thirſt after ſenſual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, <hi>that Bread</hi> which is the natural Food and Nouriſhment of our Souls: By by theſe Ordinances our Faith is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, our Hope confirm'd, our Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd, our Devotions render'd more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and by the Force of our united Prayers, we take even Heaven it ſelf. God pours out a double Portion of his Holy Spirit, upon ſuch as frequent his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note> and our Saviour Chriſt has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, that <hi>when two or three are gathered together, he will be in the midſt of them.</hi> Who then would omit one opportunity of ſerving God in <hi>Publick?</hi> who would neglect to joyn himſelf to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's People one Lord's Day? when he knows not but he loſes that Seaſon of Grace, which would be moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to his immortal Soul. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglect no opportunity of ſerving God, for we know not when the Spirit of God will work moſt powerfully on our Hearts. The poor impotent Man had lain a long while at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and yet had he been abſent but that one time when our Saviour came thither, 'tis high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable he had never been cur'd. And therefore let no excuſe Serve, let no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103240:62"/>divert us from making our conſtant Approaches unto God's Altar: For <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit blows</hi> when, as well as <hi>where it liſteth,</hi> and we muſt blame our ſelves, if thro' our own neglect, we loſe the Benefit of his Operations. Some indeed pretend, that tho they are not ſo frequent at the Church, yet they make it up in their Cloſets, but God will not thus be compounded with: Our private Devotions are unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly our Duty, our particular Wants call for our private Prayers, and our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mercies for our private Thankſgivings; but we ſhall not reap any Benefit by them, when they occaſion the neglect of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>in Publick.</hi> When two Duties ſtand in Competition one with another, we ought to apply our Minds to that Duty, whereby moſt Glory will accrue to God, moſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to our Neighbour, and which will beſt ſerve to promote the good of our own Souls: And ſince all theſe Ends are beſt obtain'd, by the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God,</hi> 'tis but reaſonable that our Private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions ſhould give place to it. And yet there is no neceſſity that either of them ſhould be neglected; every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will find convenient Times and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for both of them: But when there is a neceſſity, that one of them ſhould be omitted, we may aſſure our ſelves God
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103240:62"/>will be beſt pleas'd, when we make the moſt <hi>Publick Acknowledgments</hi> of his Goodneſs, and joyn together to implore his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome few of thoſe many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which ought to prevail with us, to give a conſtant Attendance on the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God.</hi> I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That this Worſhip ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, in the moſt ſolemn and decent manner imaginable; in that <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> which becomes every devout Worſhipper, and which the Text requires of us. That we may underſtand the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Expreſſion, it will be uſeful to conſider, that the words in the Original are differently render'd by Interpreters: Some will have them tranſlated <hi>in orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Sanctitatis;</hi> and then they denote that true Faith, and thoſe Holy Affections of Soul, with which every devout Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought to approach the Throne of God. Others chuſe rather to render them, <hi>cum decenti Sanctimonio;</hi> which more plainly denotes, That Reverence and Decency of Behaviour, which certainly becomes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who ſpeaks to the great Creator and Governour of the World. The Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint following the literal Sence of the Words reads it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Place, in which God was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103240:63"/>worſhip'd amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> denoting to us, that the fitteſt Place for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is that which is Conſecrated and Dedicated to that Purpoſe: That God will afford his more immediate Preſence in that Place,
<note place="margin">Ezra. 6.12.</note> 
               <hi>In which he has choſen to ſet his Name,</hi> and will there diſpence to us the larger Effuſions of his Grace. For tho' God is preſent at all Times, and in all Places, and hearkens even to the Sighs of the Priſoner, who lies in the deepeſt Dungeon: Yet the Church is as it were his Throne, from whence he gives <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Audience,</hi> where we have moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect a ſpeedy Anſwer to our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. And therefore the Pſalmiſt ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeats that Exhortation, <hi>of comming and appearing before God in his Courts. And Strength and Beauty are in his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi> The 6th. and 8th. Verſes of this Pſalm.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take in all theſe different Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then they will give us the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of worſhipping God in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> in its utmoſt Latitude. Which conſiſts in theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the good Diſpoſition of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the becoming and ſuitable Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of our Bodies.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:103240:63"/>
            <p n="3">III. In the Decency and Solemnity of thoſe Circumſtances, which attend our Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> conſiſts in the good Diſpoſition of our Souls; when our Underſtandings are fill'd with glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ideas of God's Power, Majeſty, and Goodneſs; our Wills reſign'd to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will; and our Affections drawn out after him; when the Conſideration of his Majeſty, produces an Holy Awe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in our Souls; his Truth and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Truſt and Reliance on him; his Goodneſs, Gratitude and Thankfulneſs for his Mercies, Love and Charity towards all Men; in ſhort, when the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on God's glorious Attributes, begets in our Souls, Affections ſuitable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, then are our Minds duly qualified and prepared, to perform that Spiritual Worſhip which God is beſt pleas'd with, and takes moſt delight in.

               <hi>For God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipp'd in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> And therefore 'tis no wonder, that of ſo many, who frequent the <hi>Publick Worſhip of God,</hi> ſo few reap Benefit by it, becauſe the Generality of Worſhippers render themſelves uncapable of receiving thoſe Bleſſings, which God offers them in his Holy Ordinances: They
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103240:64"/>come into God's Courts careleſly and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, without a due Sence of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of thoſe Duties they are going to perform; their Minds are full of vain, worldly, and ſinful Thoughts, polluted with carnal Deſires, and Affections; and then no wonder that they take ſo little delight in the Service of God, and reap no more Benefit by it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we would worſhip God in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> we muſt comport our ſelves after ſuch a manner, as is ſutable to the Duty we are about; and expreſs the Zeal and Fervency of our Souls, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expreſſive Geſtures of our Bodies.

            </p>
            <p>A due Senſe alſo of the importance of the Buſineſs we are about, would have the ſame Effect; for were we begging of God ſome temporal Bleſſing, which we might well be without, indifferency in our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103240:64"/>would better become us; but when the eternal Welfare of our Souls lies at ſtake, when we are Candidates for an everlaſting Inheritance, we cannot be too earneſt, we cannot be too Devout; had we a thouſand hands, and a thouſand tongues, they might all of them be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to expreſs the Devotion of our Souls, and the Fervency of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 'Tis not a bare joyning in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, a repeating the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes, and putting our ſelves in that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture the Rubrick enjoyns; 'tis not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the Indecencies of a prophane or clowniſh Worſhipper, I am now pleading for; this the Cuſtom of the place, good Manners, and gentile Education, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act from us: But that we go farther, and by the Humility, Gravity, and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs] of our Behaviour, ſtir up Holy Affections in our own Minds, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to imitate our Example.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſiſt, in the Decency and Solemnity of thoſe Circumſtances, which Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our Worſhip. Which tho' they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Rites and Ceremonies in their own Nature indifferent, yet are ordain'd to an excellent end, and are of admirable uſe for the promoting Devotion, and Uniformity in the Service of God. The Generality
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103240:65"/>of Mankind are very much influenc'd by the ſhews and appearances of things, and whatſoever is pleaſing to the Eye, has an eaſier Admiſſion, and makes a deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Mind. And therefore it has been the Care of Holy and Devout Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in all Ages of the World, when Religion had the Countenance of Publick Authority, and was in a flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to build Churches for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God,</hi> to keep them in good Repair, to furniſh them with ſuch Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Worſhip of God may be perform'd orderly, decently, and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and appear regular, and beautiful in the Eyes of the Beholders; and hereby raiſe up in their Minds awful, and reverent Thoughts of that God, who is there wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.

            <p>THE latter part of this Chapter is a Recapitulation of ſeveral Truths deliver'd in the Body of this Epiſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there is no ſtrict Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, neither have they any exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance one upon another; only the words of the Text, and thoſe which go immediately before, do bear ſome Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in the Verſe before the Text the Apoſtle gives Directions concerning our Practice of thoſe things which are Good: We muſt carefully examine all things by the Touch-ſtone of God's word, whether Doctrines or Practices, and we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between thoſe which ſeem and appear to be good, and thoſe which are really ſo; We muſt reject the one, and hold faſt the other. <hi>Prove all things, hold
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103240:68"/>faſt that which is good:</hi> But we muſt take quite different Meaſures, in relation to thoſe things which are Evil, which either are plainly contrary to the Law of God, or which we have any probable Reaſon to ſuſpect are ſo: <hi>We muſt abſtain from all appearance of Evil.</hi> There is indeed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interpretation of theſe words; thoſe who follow the Syriac Verſion render them, <hi>Abſtain from every kind of Evil:</hi> But ſince this Word is not ſo rendred in any other place of the New Teſtament, nor is there any Reaſon from the Scope and Coherence of the words to tranſlate it ſo, I ſhall rather chuſe with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Interpreters, to follow the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlation, and render it as in my Text, <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of Evil;</hi> and the rather,

                  </gap>.</note> becauſe the poſitive part of this Precept, is contained in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>The words thus underſtood may be conſider'd, either as they relate to the Articles of our Faith; or, as a Rule for the directing our Lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The latter of theſe is chiefly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text; and therefore my preſent Enquiry ſhall be, What thoſe Actions and Practices are which have the <hi>appearance of Evil,</hi> and from which we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abſtain.</hi> That I may give a more
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103240:68"/>plain and ſatisfactory Anſwer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: I ſhall conſider theſe words, 1. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; and 2. As they bear a Reſpect and Relation to our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Taken abſolutely, they may be reſolv'd into this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>That we muſt not do any Action, which either really is, or has the Bluſh, or <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If conſider'd with Reſpect to our Neighbour they import,</p>
            <p>That we muſt abſtain from all ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which may probably be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Offence, or Scandal to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the words abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then they import theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That we muſt abſtain from every Action, Word, or Thought, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Divine Law.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That we muſt abſtain even from lawful Actions, if they appear Evil to us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That we muſt abſtain from all ſuch Actions, which have any Tendency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, inſnare, and tempt us into Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we muſt abſtain from every Action, Word, or Thought, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103240:69"/>to the Divine Law, though it may appear of never ſo little Concernment. Whatſoever is a breach of God's Law, tho' in the ſmalleſt, and moſt inconſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, muſt be carefully avoided by us; becauſe every ſuch Tranſgreſſion will expoſe us to God's Anger, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence render us liable to everlaſting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Let us therefore carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void even the lighter breaches of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let us make a Covenant with our Eyes, and ſet a watch over the thoughts of our hearts, and take Care that we do not offend with our Tongue; remembring that at the laſt day, every idle word muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, and that in God's Book, all the Thoughts and Intents of our Hearts are recorded. Some Sins are indeed of a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Dye than others, and do admit of more heinous Aggravations: Sins committed wilfully and preſumptuouſly, are more hateful to God, waſt the Conſcience more, and by conſequence are more dangerous to the ſafety of our Souls, than thoſe Sins into which we are betray'd by the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Natures, and the ſurprize of a Temptation. But if we conſider Sin in it ſelf, and in its own Nature, no Sin can be ſmall or little, or as the Papiſts ſpeak, Venial; for every Sin is <hi>a willful Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.4.</note> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103240:69"/>wilfully offends God, juſtly incurrs the Sentence of eternal Damnation: Nay even the lighter breaches of our Duty, may be attended with ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Aggravations, as may render them of more pernicious Conſequence unto us, than thoſe which in their own Nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a greater Guilt; a ſmall Injury done on purpoſe, to vilifie and reproach us, is reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more heinouſly, than when we ſuſtain a greater Damage thro' the Folly and Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency of our Neighbour; and therefore we have Reaſon to conclude, That the leaſt Sin willfully committed, and obſtinately perſevered in, will deprive us utterly of God's Favour and Protection. How vain and dangerous then, is that known diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sin amongſt the Papiſts, into Sins venial, and Sins mortal <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, into ſuch Sins as do deſerve eternal Damnation, and ſuch as only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome Temporary Puniſhment? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince under the Head of venial Sins, they rank the groſſeſt Enormities; ſo that even Murder ſhall become a venial Sin, if committed to maintain a Man's Honour, or under Pretence of returning ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Affront. A Box on the Ear, has been made by ſome Jeſuitical Caſuiſts, a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Provocation for a Man to imbrue his hands in the Blood of his Neighbour;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103240:70"/>tho' our Saviour has in expreſs Terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd the quite contrary; ſo plainly do theſe Men make void the Law of God, by their Traditions and Diſtinctions. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt abſtain even from lawful and juſtifiable Actions, if they appear Evil to us. For we are told, That <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin (i. e.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> whoſoever doth any Action without that perſwaſion and aſſurance of Mind, of the Lawfulneſs of his doings (which is here call'd Faith) he ſins in ſo doing. 'Tis therefore our Duty to Act according to the preſent Perſwaſion of our own Minds; and having us'd the beſt means to inform our Conſciences of what is good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, convenient and moſt expedient to be done, and by conſequence moſt pleaſing unto God; to walk according to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in Uprightneſs and Integrity: And there is no Queſtion, but he who thus Acts according to the Light of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and performs what he ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be his Duty, will be more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable when he doth amiſs; than that Man who thinks he Acts in Contradiction to the Divine Will, and his own Knowledge, tho' he ſhould happen to be in the right: For no Actions are good, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of the Will of him who performs them; and therefore he who reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103240:70"/>an Action which he believes to be a Tranſgreſſion of the Divine Law, doth violence to his own Conſcience, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a very heinous Sin, tho' the Action in it ſelf ſhould be lawful and Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. For our Conſcience is God's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in our Souls, and ſuſtains the part of a Judge, as well as a Witneſs and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer; and ſuppoſing our Conſcience du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd, whilſt we follow its Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, we cannot do amiſs. But yet this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if we were hereby excus'd from performing a known, and abſolutely neceſſary Duty; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not fully ſatisfy'd, in the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of every minute Circumſtance, which is requir'd to the performance of it. This would adminiſter Fuel to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and ſcruples in the Service of God, as would render Chriſt's eaſie Yoke far more Burthenſome, than all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Jewiſh-Law. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are commanded by an unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Authority, to perform an Action which our Conſciences tell us, is lawful and neceſſary to be done; our Chriſtian Prudence will direct us not to be too nice, in weighing every particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in this Caſe to prefer our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a known Law of God, or our lawful Governours, before the trivial
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103240:71"/>Doubts, of an unſetled and wavering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe the willful Omiſſion of a known Duty, is certainly a grievous Sin; whereas we are not certain, whether the performing of it, with that queſtionable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is ſo or no; and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence will direct us, rather to venture upon ſome Circumſtances of an Action we are not ſo fully ſatisfy'd in, than on the Omiſſion of a known Duty, which is certainly a Sin; and to abſtain from thoſe Actions which are manifeſtly Evil, rather than from thoſe which have only the <hi>Appearance</hi> of it: Thus a common Soldier is oblig'd to execute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Superiour Officer, a Servant of his Maſter, without playing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt, and nicely enquiring into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them; they are only the hands which are to execute what the Head Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and if the Action is not plainly Contradictory to the known Laws of God or the Land, they ought to Obey: Their Superiours will be anſwerable for all the leſſer Defects, whilſt there will be great Allowances made to that Man, who for the maintenance of Order and Diſcipline, Peace and Charity, not only Sacrifices his own private Opinions, but ſquares his Actions in things of leſſer moment, ſo,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103240:71"/>as to comply with the great Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt abſtain from ſuch Actions, as have any Tendency to incite, enſnare, and tempt us unto Sin; and avoid as far as poſſibly we can, all ſuch things as are the neceſſary Occaſions, and Incentives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Evil: For he that wills the Cauſe, wills the neceſſary Effects, and Conſequences which follow thereupon; he that expoſes himſelf to Temptation is Blame-worthy, tho' he doth not fall into it, nor is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd thereby. 'Tis the Buſineſs and Duty of a reaſonable Being, by reflecting on its paſt Actions, to collect from thence, what will be the neceſſary Effects and Conſequences of things; and to avoid not only thoſe things which are Evil in the leaſt Degree, but alſo all thoſe which were the Inlets and Inducements to it. The true ſpiritual Warrior will not have any Parley with his Enemy, he ſtands continually on his Guard, and will not ſuffer him to make the leaſt Approaches towards him; well knowing that he is only then ſecure when his Enemies have not the Power and Ability to hurt him; and that the firſt ſtep towards his Ruin is to be ſecure;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6.</note> and to fanſie he ſtands <hi>ſo faſt, that he can never be moved.</hi> It will be therefore the wiſeſt Courſe for every one to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103240:72"/>what Sins he is moſt addicted to, what Vices bear the greateſt ſway in his Temper and Conſtitution, how he comes to be betray'd into theſe Sins, what were the Occaſions, the Motives and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them; and let him take up the Reſolution of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before mine Eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.3.</note> I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move far from me all ſuch Objects and Examples, Shews and Appearances, as may prove a ſnare to me, and betray me into Sin.</p>
            <p>Thus for Example, If he finds himſelf of a malicious and revengeful Temper, let him as much as poſſibly he can avoid being Angry; let him endeavour to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and keep under his Paſſion, when firſt rais'd, and throw theſe Coals out of his Boſom as ſoon as he can, for 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould retain them long the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

That ſpark which might eaſily have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, will be ungovernable when blown up into a Flame; and therefore 'tis the ſafeſt way, either to bring our ſelves to ſuch a meek and humble Temper
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103240:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Mind, as not to be angry at all: Or to reſtrain it within its due Bounds, and hereby prevent its being criminal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If he finds himſelf addicted to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and Luſt, let him <hi>make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> and abſtain from all ſuch things, as <hi>make proviſion for the Fleſh;</hi> let him give himſelf up to Faſting and Prayer, and uſe ſuch wholſome Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as may bring his Appetites into Subjection to the reaſonable Powers of his Soul. If Drunkenneſs is his darling Vice, let <hi>him not look upon the wine when it is red, when it gives its colour in the Cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that at laſt it biteth like a Serpent,</hi>

               <hi>and ſtingeth like an Adder. Let him put a knife to his throat (in Solomons phraſe)</hi> when he is in pleaſant and agreeable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> conſider the Danger he is in of abuſing thoſe Bleſſings of God to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Luxury, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for his Comfort and Support; and let him as much as poſſibly he can avoid all ſuch Places and Company, as are likely to promote Exceſs and Riot. Thus we find that <hi>Joſeph</hi> being ſollicited by his Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious Miſtreſs, to defile his Maſter's Bed, would not ſo much as hearken unto her,
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.10.</note> 
               <hi>or tarry with her in the houſe.</hi> The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes</hi> being forbid the uſe of Wine, would
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103240:73"/>not eat the husk and kernel of the Grape; nay ſo careful were they to avoid all the Temptations to Sin, that they would not ſo much as paſs through a Vineyard, leſt they ſhould covet the forbidden Fruit. Very remarkable is the Example of that excellent Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who being betray'd to ſome raſh and ſinful Actions by the ſudden tranſports of his Paſſion, oblig'd himſelf never to execute any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment, till he had firſt repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord's Prayer; that by giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf time for ſecond and more ſober Thoughts, he might calmly deliberate what he ought to do. Many more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be added, were it needful; this being a Rule of daily uſe, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by Heathens as well as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And now having endeavour'd to ſtate this Queſtion, how we ought to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of Evil</hi> in matters Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, in Relation to our ſelves, I ſhall proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How we ought to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of Evil</hi> with Relation to others; for the doing good to others, is as abſolutely neceſſary, as the being good our ſelves; and our great Buſineſs in this World, next to the Salvation of our own Souls, is the being beneficial to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103240:73"/>and the endeavouring by all ways poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to promote his Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare; whereby we ſhall not only pleaſe God and glorifie him, but purſue our own true Intereſt alſo: For ſince every Man has a ſhare in the good of that Society in which he lives, whatſoever benefit accrues to the Community, muſt in the end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound upon every particular Member of it; and therefore the beſt way to ſecure to our ſelves the Help and Aſſiſtance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when we have occaſion for it; is to be as uſeful and helpful, as poſſibly we can be to thoſe who are embark'd with us in the ſame common Intereſt.
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.9.</note> 
               <hi>For a good Man one would even dare to die</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle.) Goodneſs or a Charitable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards our Neighbour <hi>(i. e.)</hi> an Inclination to do all the Good we are able to all Men, is a Temper of Mind, which carries ſuch endearing Charms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, that a Man would rather venture his own Life, than ſuch a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to Mankind ſhould be depriv'd of his: And therefore 'tis both our Duty and Intereſt, to employ all thoſe Talents God has entruſted us with for the common Good, and to lay out our Time and Thoughts in being beneficial to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom we live; in inſtructing the Ignorant, reproving the faulty, making
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103240:74"/>Peace amongſt ſuch as are at Variance, and adminiſtring to all the Neceſſities of our Brother, and expending in works of Charity, whatſoever we have more than will make a comfortable Proviſion for our ſelves and Families, according to that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Condition in which God has plac'd us in the World. This is a Duty laid down negatively in the Text. We muſt <hi>abſtain from all appearance of Evil. (i.e.)</hi> We muſt ſet ſo ſtrict a Watch over all our Words and Actions, that we neither ſpeak nor Act any thing which may be to the Prejudice, or Offence of our Brother: we muſt not only take Care, that we be not openly injurious to him, or do him wrong in his Perſon, Eſtate, or Good Name; but we muſt avoid ſpeaking any word that looks like an Injury, or has tho' but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tendency to his Diſparagement and Diſgrace, or which has any Probability of being miſ-interpreted for an Affront; if we foreſee it may draw any ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence after it, or give him any Cauſe of juſt Offence, we ought to reſtrain our ſelves, and by no means to utter it. And if ſo, then herein is imply'd, that we do to our Neighbour all the good Turns which lie in our Power, that we love him as our ſelves, and make our own Self-love the rule and meaſure of our Words,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103240:74"/>and Actions towards him, and in all things <hi>dealing with him, as we our ſelves</hi> if we were in the ſame Circumſtances,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note> 
               <hi>would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be dealt withal.</hi> All theſe poſitive Duties are contain'd in the words of the Text, and as ſtrictly enjoyn'd us, and as Emphatically expreſs'd, as they could be by any poſitive Command.</p>
            <p>This is a Duty dictated to us by the Light of Nature, enjoyn'd us almoſt in every Page of the New Teſtament, and enforc'd by the moſt powerful Inducements, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Intereſt, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. A Duty which God ſeems ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for, that he has declar'd he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpence with his own immediate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than it ſhould be omitted;
<note place="margin">Matth. 9.13.</note> 
               <hi>he is better pleas'd with Mercy</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> doing good to our Neighbour,) <hi>than with Sacrifice:</hi> A Duty which even the worſt of Men, thoſe who ſeem to have caſt off all Fear of God, and Senſe of Religion think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perform. For a Senſe and Principle of Honour, is ſufficient to engage Men to bear a ſincere Affection to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and their Friend, to be juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Dealings, and punctual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of their Word. We may find Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples enough amongſt the Heathens, of thoſe who have been Patriots to their Country, and have given the world the moſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103240:75"/>generous Inſtances of an inviolable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and therefore I ſhall urge no more Arguments for the performance of ſo plain and neceſſary a Duty, but proceed to lay down ſome Rules to direct us in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. And ſince our Actions are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good, or Evil, or Indifferent, I ſhall lay down three general Rules, in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every one of theſe: And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. We muſt not be ſo deſirous of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to our Neighbour, as to do any Action in its own Nature, or by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſequence Evil; tho' we are aſſur'd ſome great good might be effected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We muſt ſometimes omit even good Actions, when they may probably be the Occaſion of ſome Evil, or a reaſonable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence may be taken at the performance of them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In things indifferent, 'tis our Duty many times to abridge our ſelves in our Chriſtian Liberty, for the good of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to <hi>abſtain</hi> from ſuch things which we foreſee will give him juſt occaſion of Scandal and Offence. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt not do the leaſt evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under this Pretence, that much Glory will accrue to God, or much good to our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103240:75"/>Neighbour thereby; for God has not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us any Permiſſon, much leſs has he laid upon us any Neceſſity of committing the leaſt Sin, tho' upon never ſo plauſible a Pretence; he has chalk'd out to us the plain Path of Integrity and Honeſty, and has plac'd a <hi>Monitor</hi> within us, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gives us this Advice,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.21.</note> 
               <hi>This is the way walk therein;</hi> and whenever we go aſtray through the Sollicitation of a prevailing Luſt, he recalls us unto the Practice of our Duty. As the end to which all our Actions ought to tend, is Holy; ſo he has appointed ſuch means to attain it, as are pure and Holy too; and has given us ſufficient Power to do our Duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of any indirect means. It highly derogates from the Honour of an abſolutely good and all powerful Being to fanſie, that he cannot bring about his Deſigns by juſt and lawful means; or that he has any occaſion for the Sins of Men to advance his Glory. What can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man have to ſay for himſelf more than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> had, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9. who dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Cart in which the Ark of God was plac'd, and ſeeing the Oxen ſtumble, ſo that the Ark was in manifeſt Danger of falling, put forth his hand and took hold of the Ark, which was only lawful for the Prieſts to do; and we are told Verſe 10.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103240:76"/>
               <hi>That the anger of the Lord was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza, and he ſmote him, becauſe he put his hand to the Ark and he died there before God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> has plainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd this Point with a God forbid. <hi>And not rather as we are ſlanderouſly reported of,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.6.8.</note> 
               <hi>and as ſome affirm that we ſay, Let us do Evil that Good may come, whoſe Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is juſt.</hi> The Almighty Arm of God is ſufficient for the Government of the World; and ſince he can bring about the wiſe Deſigns of his Providence, by an immediate Act of his Power, he has no need of our Aſſiſtance: And therefore when we venture upon any unlawful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of an honeſt Deſign (as we think) of doing good, we uſurp God's Prerogative, and interpoſe in that which doth not belong to us: Like undiſciplin'd Soldiers we run out of our Ranks, and leave the Poſts in which we were plac'd; and tho' we may do ſome Service, yet we muſt expect to be puniſh'd for our Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Diſobed nce. And for the moſt part God blaſts the Deſigns of ſuch Men, who care not what means they make uſe of to bring them about: They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unſucceſsful in their Enterprizes, and convinc'd by fatal Experience, that the moſt hopeful Attempts prove Abortive, unleſs proſper'd and protected by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103240:76"/>Grace and Bleſſing; thus it is for the moſt part, but whenever it proves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and God ſees it fit to permit evil Men to proſper for ſome time, yet there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome fatal Calamity or other, which either attends, or follows ſuch ſinful Actions; and puts a plain difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Uprightneſs of the Righteous, and the crooked and perverſe Ways of the wicked. Let us therefore never be prevail'd on to do the leaſt Evil, tho' for a good End; for God has obliged us to do no more Good, than lawfully we can do; nay Good ceaſes to be ſo, and turns into Evil, when brought about by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Means: For to a good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'tis neceſſary that every Circumſtance do concur, and that the means as well as the end is agreeable to the Laws of God; tho' a Deficiency in any one Circumſtance is ſufficient to denominate it an evil A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 'Tis therefore our wiſeſt Courſe to make the Law of God, the Rule of all our Actions, and he who is juſtly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how often he tranſgreſſes this Law, will never be guilty of the Folly, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be righteous over-much, and to do what God has not made his Duty. But this is not all. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may ſo happen, that a good Action lawfully may and ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103240:77"/>when ſome Evil may proceed, or ſome Scandal may be taken at the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. For tho' we are always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to do all the good we can, yet we are not oblig'd to do it at all times; 'tis in many Caſes left to our own Prudence to determine, what times and places are moſt fitting and convenient for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome Duties. The poſitive Command of God ought certainly to be obey'd and executed, when commanded us, how pernicious ſoever the Conſequence of it may ſeem to be; becauſe the Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a known Duty is a wilful Sin: Yet when only the Duty in general is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, and the time and manner of the performance of it left to our own Diſcretion; then our Chriſtian Prudence will direct us ſo to perform it, as moſt Glory may redound to God, moſt good to our Neighbour, and we our ſelves may reap moſt benefit thereby. Our Saviour Chriſt doth exhort us to imitate the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Serpent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>as well as the harmleſs Simplicity of the Dove;</hi> and 'tis the great Wiſdom of a good Man to manage and husband wiſely the Opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, that every Duty may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in its proper time and place; for as he who gives ſeaſonably is ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a double Benefit: So he that has the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103240:77"/>Skill to fit out every Duty with its proper Circumſtances, will entitle himſelf to the more excellent Reward in the World to come. For it ſometimes happens that an indifferent Action perform'd in due time and place, may have an admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on thoſe who behold it, and be the occaſion of much good, and then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Chriſtian ought to embrace ſo happy an Opportunity: At another time an Action which in it ſelf is Good and Praiſe-worthy may be the occaſion, that God may be blaſphem'd, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour injur'd; and then 'tis certainly our Duty to omit that good Action, till ſome more convenient Opportunity preſents it ſelf. This is the meaning of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rule of the Schools, <hi>Affirmativa prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta obligant ſemper, ſed non ad ſemper, (i. e.)</hi> though the poſitive Commands of God are always obliging, yet they do not always limit us to the preſent time of performing them. I ſhall make this plain by an inſtance or two; to reprove thoſe who do amiſs, eſpecially thoſe who are committed to our Care, and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Juriſdiction, is our unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duty, and enjoyn'd us by the Laws both of God and Man, but when this Duty muſt be perform'd, is left to our Chriſtian Prudence and Diſcretion; for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103240:78"/>many times, it will be neceſſary to wink at their Faults, and paſs by their Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and to leave the Correction of them till ſome other Opportunity, when we have the Proſpect of doing more good by it, herein following the Advice of our Bleſſed Saviour,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6.</note> 
               <hi>Give not that which is holy unto Dogs, neither caſt ye your Pearls before Swine, leaſt they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you:</hi> To give our Alms in Publick may ſometimes be our Duty, that we may encourage others to be liberal to the Poor, and <hi>ſo let our light ſhine before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>that others ſeeing our good works may glorifie our father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> But when this End is ſo far from being obtain'd by the Publick Diſtribution of our Alms, that it gives others occaſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we are Proud and Vain-glorious, and do it only to be ſeen of Men; then the more private our Almsdeeds are, the more acceptable they are unto God, <hi>And our heavenly Father who ſees in ſecret will reward us openly.</hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> It were eaſie to heap up many more Inſtances of this Nature, but theſe may ſuffice; and therefore I ſhall only add, That ſince it muſt be left to every ones Prudence, when theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be perform'd, and when omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore no ſtrict Rules can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the performance of them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103240:78"/>in the General we make this uſeful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; That then we Act with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prudence and Diſcretion, when we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thoſe Ends, for which thoſe Duties were at firſt inſtituted and commanded us: Thus he Adminiſters Reproof beſt, who moſt prevails upon the Perſon Reprov'd to reform and amend; and he gives his Alms to the beſt Purpoſe, whoſe Charity is moſt extenſive and ſeaſonable, in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Neceſſities of his poor Brother.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In things indifferent we ought to abridge our ſelves in our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the good of our Neighbour, and to <hi>abſtain</hi> from ſuch things as we foreſee, will give him juſt occaſion of Scandal and Offence. For though every Man is the neareſt to himſelf, and that firſt Principle of ſelf Preſervation engages us in the firſt place to conſult our Good and Happineſs; yet where ſome great benefit will accrue to my Neighbour, by an Action which brings to me only ſome inconſiderable Loſs and Detriment, I ought to remove the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of my own Advantage, to make room for the greater Good of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And ſo on the other hand, when I foreſee that my Neighbour will receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prejudice by any indifferent Action of mine (<hi>i. e.</hi> by any Action which I am no ways oblig'd either to do, or not to do)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103240:79"/>I ought to <hi>abſtain</hi> from it: Now becauſe this is a general Rule which will admit of ſome Difficulty in the Application of it, I ſhall endeavour to give ſome more particular Directions for the Government of our Practice herein. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt abſtain from all ſuch indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Actions, as we foreſee will be a ſnare in the way of our Neighbour, and tempt him to the Commiſſion of any Sin, or the Omiſſion of any known Duty. For ſince a good Man cannot but be troubled and afflicted, when he ſees his Neighbour fall into any Sin, and hereby diſhonour God, and ruine his own Soul; therefore it muſt needs be incumbent upon him to uſe all means poſſible to prevent it, and rather to retrench himſelf in his lawful, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Enjoyments, than his Neighbour ſhould receive any prejudice thereby. As for Example, the drinking a Health is an indifferent Action, which I may do or let alone, without the Commiſſion of any Sin; but when I foreſee that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Health, or the drinking of it, will be a Shooing-horn to Intemperance, and an occaſion of drinking more than is fit; or when ſome in the Company may be diſgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thereby, or it may be a probable occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of breeding Differences and Quarrels
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103240:79"/>amongſt them; then at ſuch a time and in ſuch a place, 'tis my Duty to abſtain from it. Innocent and harmleſs Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are certainly indifferent Actions, but when the ſpending our time in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, will occaſion the neglect of our Duty, either to God or Man; when they will be a ſnare in the way of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, either by betraying him into extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and ſinful Paſſions, or ſpending that Time and Subſtance which ought to be employ'd in providing for his Family, then they have <hi>the appearance of Evil,</hi> and muſt be avoided.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When an indifferent Action is liable to be miſtaken, and my Neighbour may hereby be induc'd to do an Action which is utterly unlawful, then I ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from it. Thus it was the Cuſtom of the Primitive Chriſtians, to go daily to the Tombs and Monuments of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and to pray by them, that by the remembrance of their holy Lives, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and courageous Deaths, their Zeal might be kindled, their Devotions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd more fervent, and that they might take up more ſtedfaſt Reſolutions of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Examples: But when from Praying at the Martyrs Tombs, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to commemorate them in their Prayers, and then to pray to them, and at
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103240:80"/>laſt to make Mediators and Interceſſors of them; when this indifferent and at firſt Praiſe-worthy Cuſtom was thus groſly abus'd, then it was high time for every good Chriſtian to refrain from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When my doing an indifferent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may induce my Neighbour (who is not ſatisfy'd in the Lawfulneſs of it) to do the ſame Action, then I ought to <hi>abſtain</hi> from it. This was that famous Caſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who being but newly initiated into the Chriſtian Religion, and therefore not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the Extent and Latitude of their Goſpel Liberty, thought it unlawful to eat Meats ſacrific'd to Idols, and therefore St.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.3.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> commands that they <hi>ſhould give them no offence,</hi> which <hi>Beza</hi> Interprets, <hi>Ne quidpiam ad quod poſſint impingere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that thoſe who thought it lawful to eat theſe Meats; ſhould not tempt thoſe Perſons to partake of them, who were of another Opinion; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſatisfie them of the Lawfulneſs of it, and to bear with them, and give them no occaſion of Offence till they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ought to govern our ſelves after ſuch a manner in all our indifferent Actions, that we may recommend our ſelves to the good Opinion of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and endeavour hereby to gain an
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103240:80"/>Intereſt in his Affections, that we may be enabled to do him more good, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Glory of God in the world. And therefore if we foreſee, that by any indifferent Action we ſhall forfeit his good Opinion, or that our indifferent Action is liable to his raſh Judgment, uncharitable Cenſures, and will give him occaſion to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Malice, and Ill-will in his Mind, then 'tis our Duty rather to retrench our ſelves in our lawful Liberty, than to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo much miſchief to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or to exclude our ſelves from the bleſſed Opportunities of doing him good; for 'tis the Apoſtles Advice, <hi>That we ſhould not only think on thoſe things which are juſt and honeſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>but whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any Vertue, if there be any Praiſe, think on theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I ſhall interpoſe one Caution, that in all theſe Caſes 'tis ſuppos'd, that the Action ſtill remains indifferent: For thoſe Actions which are in their own Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, may become neceſſary by ſome Circumſtance limiting and bounding them; and if my indifferent Action, is annex'd to a neceſſary Duty, or determin'd by a lawful Authority, I am no longer at Liberty which way to Act, nor will an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil be a ſufficient Excuſe, for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103240:81"/>my abſtaining from it. Theſe are ſome of thoſe Rules which the beſt Caſuiſts have laid down, but yet they will not reach to all particular Caſes, and where they fall ſhort, our Chriſtian Prudence will be the beſt Guide and Director, hereby following the Example of the Apoſtles of our Saviour Chriſt, who did not live themſelves up to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Rule, but in indifferent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuited their Actions to the Exigences of things, and comported themſelves ſo, as that they might beſt promote the Glory of God, the good of the Church. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have to deal with ſuch, as having had leiſure, and parts, and Opportunity to examine things, may reaſonably be thought to diſſent from us, our of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Deſign, and are ſo unjuſt as to deny us, that Freedom which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enjoy; my Advice is <hi>to ſtand faſt in that Liberty with which Chriſt has made us free,</hi>

The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is a plain Alluſion to the Cuſtom of the Eaſtern Countries, of plucking off their Shooes when they made any Profeſſion of ſolemn Reſpect, or trod on Conſecrated Ground, and of waſhing their Feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entred the Palaces of their Kings, or the Places dedicated to God's Publick Worſhip. Of theſe Cuſtoms we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances in the holy Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> when God appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, he commanded him <hi>to put his ſhooes from off his feet, becauſe the place whereon he ſtood was holy ground. And the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Hoſt ſaid unto Joſhua,</hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103240:83"/>who enters into the Houſe of God, and that Reverent demeanor of himſelf whilſt he is there. <hi>Keep thy feet when thou goeſt into the Houſe of God,</hi> or (as the Original may be rendred) <hi>when thou comeſt into the Houſe of God,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes to us, both how we ought to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves before we come to the place of God's Publick Worſhip, and how we muſt comport and demean our ſelves when we are there: And therefore 'tis preſently added, <hi>And be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of fools; (i.e.)</hi> be ſure to bring an attentive Ear, and an obedient Heart along with thee, with which God will be better pleas'd, than with thoſe Sacrifices whereby wicked Men think (tho' very fooliſhly) to appeaſe the Anger of God, and to render him favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and propitious to them, tho' they lead their Lives and Converſations never ſo contrary to his Laws: <hi>for they conſider not that they do Evil,</hi> they do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God has openly declar'd, That he hates and abhors the Sacrifices of ſuch Men, who offer them up with unclean hands, and an impure heart; ſuch as thoſe who think that their Attendance upon the publick Offices of Religion, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone and make amends for the wickedneſs and immorality of their Lives: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103240:83"/>the plain meaning of the words, I propoſe to make ſome Enlargement upon them, under theſe following Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider how we ought to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> our ſelves before we joyn in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How we ought to demean our ſelves whilſt we are Worſhipping him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What is to be done after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the publick Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How we ought to <hi>Prepare</hi> our ſelves before we joyn with the Congregation, in the Publick Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>For our Edifying and receiving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the Publick Duties of Religion, in a great meaſure depends on a due <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for them, 'tis to no Purpoſe <hi>to ſow the good ſeed of the Word,</hi> unleſs our Hearts are manur'd and cultivated, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd</hi> and diſpos'd to receive it. Our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be turn'd into Sin,
<note place="margin">Iſay 29.13.</note> 
               <hi>if whilſt we ſpeak to God with our lips, our hearts are far from him,</hi> nor will our receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper be of any uſe to us; if whilſt we are partaking of the Holy Elements, we cheriſh and harbour ſinful, and impure Thoughts. And here it may be ſeaſonable to take notice of a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103240:84"/>dangerous Miſtake, which many of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity are guilty of: They pretend to have a deep and ſerious Senſe, what a weighty and ſolemn Duty the receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is, and 'tis for this Reaſon that they forbear it, becauſe they think they are not <hi>ſufficiently prepared</hi> for it; and yet at the ſame time theſe very Men preſume to come to the Church, to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God's Throne, and hear his Holy Word without any <hi>Preparation</hi> at all, as if the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was the only Duty of Religion, which required Care in the performance of it. Thus they are too nice and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous on the one hand, whilſt they are too negligent and prophane on the other; they wholly omit one Ordinance of God, becauſe they do not think themſelves <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prepared</hi> for it, and loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all the reſt, becauſe they will not <hi>Prepare</hi> themſelves at all. For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon can be given, why Men who live ſo long under the moſt powerful Preaching of the Word of God, Edifie ſo little by it, why their Underſtandings are ſo little improv'd in Spiritual Matters, and their Lives and Converſations ſo little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd thereby; but becauſe they do not bring <hi>prepared Minds,</hi> and good Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103240:84"/>along with them; their Thoughts are taken up with worldly Affairs, their Hearts are fill'd with corrupt Affections, and many wicked and impure Spirits have taken Poſſeſſion of their Souls, and then no wonder, that the Holy Spirit of God doth not take up his abode with them, when they are not in a Capacity to give him any ſuitable Entertainment.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Preparation</hi> therefore is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be made before we attend on the Publick Worſhip of God: Which may be perform'd after this or ſuch like manner.</p>
            <p>Upon the Lord's Day, or any other day Dedicated to the Publick Service of God, and ſet apart from our private Employments, to the more ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our Creator, as ſoon as ever we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, let our Souls be ſeaſon'd with ſome holy and devout Meditation. Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that at the ſame time the Sun ſalutes our Eyes, and refreſheth our Bodies with his comfortable Beams,

               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note> Let us beſeech Almighty God, that his good Spirit may go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us through all the Duties of the day, and incite, ſtrengthen, and confirm us in every good Work: That he would teach us to Pray with Fervency, and an holy Aſſurance that all our Requeſts (which are conformable to the Will of God) ſhall be granted us; to hear his Word with Attention, and firm Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of performing whatſoever we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd is our Duty; and to Praiſe him with gladneſs and cheerfulneſs of Soul, with Hearts fill'd with the grateful Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Benefits, and Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us read ſome Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Scripture, and make this the Subject of our Meditation; till the hour approaches when we are call'd upon to joyn with the Congregation in our Devotions, and we hear the Summons to attend God's Publick Worſhip. It will then be time to enter upon a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conſideration, how we have paſs'd the laſt Week, how well we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd thoſe Reſolutions which we have formerly taken up, what Sins we have ſince been guilty of, what good Duties we have omitted, and that we ſhould be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for theſe our Neglects, and bewail our

            <p>This is that <hi>Preparation</hi> of Soul, which every one ought to make before he enters into the Houſe of God. For God will not be ſerv'd with unclean hands, and an unſanctify'd heart; he abhors even the moſt <hi>ſolemn Faſts of thoſe Men, who ſmite with the Fiſts of wickedneſs;</hi>

And therefore as when Men come to the Table of the Lord without due <hi>Preparation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> they <hi>trample under feet Chriſt's holy Body and Blood, and eat and drink Condemnation to themſelves:</hi> So when they frequent the Houſe of God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon his Ordinances careleſly and negligently, they grieve God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, provoke him to leave and forſake them, to give them up to hardneſs of Heart, and a reprobate Mind;

               <hi>Foraſmuch as this People</hi> (Says the Prophet) <hi>draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have remov'd their heart far from me, therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work, and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for the Wiſdom of their wiſe Men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Men ſhall be hid.</hi> God doth not now always puniſh Prophaneneſs and Coldneſs in our Devotions, with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evils, and ſickneſs in the Body, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Primitive Church: But he

               </gap> leads us by degrees into open Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Atheiſm. Let therefore every one who deſires to receive the bleſſed Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of God's holy Spirit, and that his Soul may be a Temple fitted and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him to dwell in; Let him I ſay, firſt cleanſe his Heart by a due and ſtrict Examination of himſelf, and a ſerious and hearty Repentance for the Errors of his ways; Let him thus <hi>keep his feet before he goes into the Houſe of God (i. e.)</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what Paths he has walked in, how the Affections of his Soul are fitted, and diſpos'd to partake of theſe holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Whilſt we are going towards the Houſe of God, let us entertain our ſelves with ſuch Meditations as theſe. Let us conſider the Glorious Majeſty of that God before whom we are going to appear, that he is the great Creator, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and Governour of the World, who humbles himſelf to look down upon the Sons of Men, being exalted above all
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103240:87"/>Praiſe, and exceedingly Happy and Glorious, above all that we can conceive and think: 'Tis this God who grants us Audience, and vouchſafes us the Favour of making our Addreſſes unto him: Let us conſider alſo our own Vileneſs and Sinfulneſs, how unworthy we are of ſo great Favours, and hereby raiſe up in our Souls, that humble Awe and devout Reverence of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Being,
<note place="margin">Levit. 26.2.</note> which is requir'd of every one who Worſhips God. Thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Cornelius</hi> tells <hi>Peter,</hi> That he and all the reſt <hi>were preſent before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.23.</note> 
               <hi>to hear all things which were commanded them by God, (i. e.)</hi> they had conſidered with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who it was that was to ſpeak to them, and that the words they were to hear, were not the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> a frail ſinful Man like themſelves, but the words of God. Thus before we preſent our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions unto God, we are commanded to <hi>conſider that God is in Heaven, and we on Earth; (i. e.)</hi> that there is an infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Creator and his poor Creature; that he is the moſt Perfect, the moſt Glorious, and the moſt Holy Being, but we only duſt and aſhes, vile Earth and miſerable Sinners; vile we are in our own Nature, but we have made our ſelves much more ſo, by our manifold Sins, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tranſgreſſions. When therefore we
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103240:88"/>approach the Holy Temple of the Lord, Let us ſay thus within our ſelves;
<note place="margin">Gen. 28.17.</note> 
               <hi>How dreadful is this place, this is certainly the place where the Lord dwells?</hi> I am now going to the Houſe of God, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Almighty, who has my Soul in his hand, and the breath of my Noſtrils at his diſpoſal, <hi>in whom I live, and move, and have my Being;</hi> I am drawing near to the King of Heaven and Earth, to preſent my ſelf before his Face, to pay him my Homage, and to make him the Tenders of my bounden Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Let me therefore put my Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a devout Frame, as he will accept of, and take Care that I behave my ſelf with Reverence, Decency, and Devotion.

If we would offer up unto God an acceptable Service, our Minds muſt be attentive to the Duty we are about; whilſt we are praying to God for thoſe Bleſſings we ſtand in need of, or praiſing him for thoſe we have received, we muſt either be meditating on the God we Worſhip, or, the thing we deſire or praiſe him for: For ſince Worſhip is the Acknowledgment of thoſe Excellencies and Perfections which are in the Divine Nature, 'tis impoſſible we ſhould have any ſerious Senſe, or make any due Acknowledgment of theſe Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, unleſs we keep our Minds intent upon them: We may as well commend the beauty of an Object we never ſaw, and be taken with that Muſick we never heard, as admire and acknowledge thoſe Excellencies we never thought on or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd. For to ſerve God with our Mouths, when our Thoughts are wandring ſome where elſe, and employ'd about ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs, is but Lip-Worſhip at the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103240:89"/>beſt; a Sacrifice without an heart, which God will utterly deteſt and abhor. 'Tis therefore one of the principal <hi>Devices of the Devil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>of which we ought not to be ignorant,</hi> to excite and ſtir up vain Thoughts in our Minds, during the time of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to divert them upon worldly and ſinful Objects, and hereby to deprive us of that Benefit we might otherwiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by a due and conſcientious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe Duties. And therefore it ought to be the Care of all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſtand continually upon their Guard, to bear a ſtrict Eye over their Hearts, and as ſoon as ever they find any vain and ſinful Thoughts ſpring up in their Minds, to caſt them out: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and bring back their wandering Thoughts, and never to make them their own by conſenting to them, or dwelling upon them. Some Men are more addicted to roving and volatile Thoughts than others are, from their natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Conſtitution, and therefore are not ſo blameable for that which they cannot help: But 'tis then only they are faulty, when their Will cloſes with them, when they do not make Uſe of the moſt proper means to prevent them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> A due and conſcientious <hi>Preparation</hi> of their Hearts for Religious Duties; then do they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103240:89"/>their moſt Holy Offerings, and <hi>turn the Sacrifices of their Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings into ſin.</hi> Let it therefore be our firſt and principal Care to fix our thoughts, and keep them attentive to the Duties we are about, and we ſhall ſoon find that he who has thus well begun, has half finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his work: If we can but once bring our ſelves to be ſerious and attentive, to apply our Minds to the Worſhip of God, this will naturally produce</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Intention and Ardency of our Affections:
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> For the Duties of Religion are in themſelves ſo <hi>reaſonable a Service,</hi> ſo excellently fitted to bring about thoſe Ends for which they were appointed, and ſo agreeable to the Faculties of our Soul; that there is requir'd little more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to our liking and delight, than a ſober and ſerious Application of our Minds, and a daily and conſtant accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoming our ſelves to them. It will be tedious and irkſome to us at the firſt, to ſpend our time in Religious Duties, to pray and hear God's word, and meditate upon it; but when we have once got the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over our corrupt and ſtubborn Natures, by a daily Practice of theſe Duties; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will yield us ſo much Pleaſure and Delight on this ſide Heaven, as the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Prayers before God, the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103240:90"/>open our Wants, and begging Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, the magnifying his Name for Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits beſtow'd upon us, and communicating to others the grateful Reſentments of our Souls. Theſe are the Employments of Saints and Angels above, and will create a kind of Heaven in every good Man's breaſt, whoſe Mind is taken up with ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conceptions, and joyful Reſentments as theſe.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note> 
               <hi>Theſe</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> tells us) <hi>are ſweeter than the honey and the honey comb.</hi> Which made him chuſe rather, <hi>to ſpend one day in God's Courts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 84.10.</note> 
               <hi>than a thouſand elſe-where. Let us therefore Worſhip the Lord our God with all our heart, and all our mind, and all our ſoul.</hi> Let us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Truth with our Underſtandings, treaſure it up in our Memories, and careſs it with our Affections. Let us pray unto him with Faith, Zeal, and Fervency; and praiſe him with a due Admiration of his Goodneſs, and grateful Reſentments of his Mercy and Loving-kindneſs; and then nothing will remain but that,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We cloſe with it by our Wills, and conform them to his Divine Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. That we reſolve to amend our Lives in every particular wherein we have done amiſs, and to yield a ſincere Obedience to the Laws of God, in every known Inſtance of our Duty; that we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103240:90"/>may not perform our Devotions, only that we may be thought to be Religious, but that we may be really ſo; and not only be wiſer Men, but better Chriſtians. For the end of all the Devotional parts of Religion is chiefly to lead us unto Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; they are enjoyn'd us as helps and means to aſſiſt us, <hi>To direct our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aright,</hi> and that hereby we may be the better enabled to live up to the Rules of Reaſon and Religion. Do but take any particular Duty into your Conſideration, and you will find, that it has a neceſſary influence upon our Lives, and a direct Tendency to aſſiſt us, in a due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty. For Inſtance, would it not be abſurd to imagine, that God has commanded us to Repent of our Sins, becauſe he takes delight in the Sighs and Tears of the Penitent Sinner? For he who is a Being of infinite Goodneſs, is never better pleas'd, than when he is doing us good, and communicating his Bleſſings unto us: But the Reaſon why he commands us to Repent, is that he may make us ſenſible of the Evil Nature of our Sins, and the Miſery and Ruin which our Vices betray us into; and that hereby we may be deterr'd from thoſe Actions, which are ſo diſhonourable to God, and ſo prejudicial to our ſelves: Nor would it be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103240:91"/>more reaſonable to Fancy, that our Prayers and Praiſes make any addition to his Glory, or increaſe his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for he is infinitely, and therefore perfectly happy in the Enjoyment of himſelf; but theſe Duties are enjoyn'd us, that by the performance of them, our Souls may be more ſeriouſly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a humble Senſe of our own weakneſs, and a grateful Reſentment of God's Goodneſs, whereby we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to yield the readier Obedience to his Commands, and be drawn by <hi>theſe cords of a man</hi> to obey his Laws. I might inſtance in all the other Duties of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religion,
<note place="margin">Hoſea 11.4.</note> but from what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid it plainly appears, That all the parts of Publick Worſhip do directly tend to make Men more Holy in this Life, in order to make them more Happy in that which is to come; and that then it doth obtain the End for which it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we take up Reſolutions of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, and of conforming our Wills to the Divine Will and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhew'd what that Worſhip of our Souls is, which God requires of us; that it conſiſts in the Attention of our Thoughts, the Intention of our Minds, and the Harmony of our Wills with God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will. I come to conſider,</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:103240:91"/>
            <p n="2">2. How we ought to Worſhip God with our Bodies: For ſince our Bodies, as well as our Souls were the Workmanſhip of his hands, 'tis but highly reaſonable we ſhould pay him the Homage of them, <hi>and ſerve him alſo with our Bodies which are his.</hi> That we ſhould diſpoſe our ſelves during the time of Divine Worſhip to ſuch Decent, becoming, and reverential Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, that we may make it evident to all Men, that our whole Man is dedicated to his Service. And this will be beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by bearing in mind this general Rule, <hi>That we put on that Gravity, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of Looks and Behaviour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our ſelves after ſuch a manner, as the belief of God's immediate Preſence, and the ſolemnity of his Worſhip requires from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though Irreverence, and Indecency in the Publick Worſhip of God, is by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſteem'd a light and trivial Offence, and hardly worth taking notice of; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this falſe Notion, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with; That if they ſerve God with their Minds and Spirits, 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what their bodily Behaviour is: Yet this will be found to be a groſs Miſtake, and of dangerous and pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if weigh'd in the Balance of the Sanctuary, and of unprejudic'd Reaſon; for,</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:103240:92"/>
            <p n="1">1. Why ſhould we believe thoſe Men will Worſhip God with their Souls and Spirits, who will not Worſhip him with their Bodies? If they will not do ſo eaſie a thing, as to comport their ſelves decently and affectionately, during the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, 'tis not probable that they ſhould perform, that which is far more difficult, to Worſhip him with Intention of Soul, and Ardency of Affection. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires their utmoſt Diligence and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keep their Minds attentive, and to go along with the Congregation in all the parts of Publick Worſhip, which theſe Men will never take the Pains to perform, who both by their Looks and Geſtures declare, That their Minds are in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and employ'd on ſome other Buſineſs. A multitude of needleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Ceremonies, ſuch as are enjoyn'd in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tend to divert our Minds from the buſineſs we are about, and make ſo much imployment for our Bodies, that 'twould be very difficult to ſerve him with our Souls: But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be laid to the Charge of our Religious Worſhip, nor do I plead for them; 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a devout and reverential Deportment of our ſelves I would inforce, a behaving our ſelves with that Decency and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity our Church preſcribes, that Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103240:92"/>and Seriouſneſs, that humble Proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Bodies and Souls, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Men who are in the immediate Preſence of the great God of Heaven and Earth. That this is our Duty will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Nature of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which (as I have formerly obſerv'd) conſiſts in that Awe and Reverence which Men have for the Divine Majeſty, and the Senſe of that infinite diſtance which is between the Creator and his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who continually depend upon him for every thing they enjoy; which makes them approach his Preſence with Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind, and a profound Adoration of his infinite Perfections, and will diſcover it ſelf in their Looks, Words, and Actions: For there is ſo cloſe an Union between our Souls and Bodies, that when the one is ſeriouſly affected, the other cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unconcern'd; when our Minds are fill'd with glorious Ideas of God's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perfections, his Majeſty, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Loving-kindneſs towards us; we may as well think <hi>to carry Fire in our Boſoms, and not be burn'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6.27.</note> as to contain our ſelves from diſcovering the Sentiments of our Minds, by viſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103240:93"/>
            <p>Beſides 'tis Eſſential to Publick Worſhip, that we make known the Thoughts of our Souls, by Publick Tokens of Reverence and Signs of Honour; this being one chief end of our Worſhipping God in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.6.</note> that <hi>we may with one mind, and one mouth glorifie God,</hi> and incite and ſtir up one another, to praiſe and adore him, and declare to the whole World, what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence we retain for his infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which can no other ways be done, but by our external Behaviour, and devout Deportment of our ſelves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis worth our Obſervation, <hi>That there never was any man deſervedly eminent for Piety and Devotion, who did not joyn Bodily Worſhip with his mental Adorations.</hi> I ſhall only add a third Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God and his holy Angels are preſent in our Congregations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to be more careful, that we behave our ſelves Decently, and carry our ſelves with Humility and Reſpect (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering our Heads, and bending our Bodies, and giving all the Signs of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and readineſs to yield Obedience to his Commands) than we would be in the Preſence of a temporal Prince. Did God appear in our Churches in a viſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as formerly he did in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> there is no queſtion but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103240:93"/>that the Dread of his glorious Majeſty, would put every one of us into the moſt humble and devout Poſtures; <hi>yet God is here preſent of a truth though we know it not;</hi> God and his holy Angels do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look down and behold us, but are as certainly preſent in this Congregation, as if we beheld them with our Bodily Eyes. Let us therefore proſtrate our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.6.</note> 
               <hi>And kneel before the Lord our Maker;</hi> let us give him the Worſhip of our Souls, and of our Bodies, <hi>And praiſe him in the Congregation of his Saints, and bow down our ſelves before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I come to conſider in the laſt place, what is to be done after the performance of the Publick Duties of Religion. And here that the good Seed of the Word may take deep root in our Hearts; let us not give up our Minds to our ſecular Affairs, and worldly Thoughts, as ſoon as ever Divine Service is ended, much leſs ſhould we let looſe our Thoughts to Paſtimes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, though never ſo innocent and harmleſs; for were there no Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, common Prudence would dictate to us, that the beſt way to fix thoſe Truths we have heard upon our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is to take ſome time to recollect our ſelves, and to digeſt what we have heard by ſerious Meditation; and that in all
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103240:94"/>Probability the diverting our Thoughts to other Employments, will deface all thoſe good Impreſſions the word of God has made on our Minds, blot them out of our Memories, and make thoſe Truths which have been deliver'd <hi>like the Seed ſown by the way ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13.5.</note> which becomes a prey to the Fowls of the Air. Let us therefore ſpend ſome time in recollecting what the Preacher has deliver'd to us, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what Article of Religion has been explain'd, what Vertue has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, what Vice reprov'd, what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Motives have been us'd, and in ſhort, in comparing the Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd with the written word of God; and if we find it agreeable to it, then let us treaſure it up in our Minds, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it into our Lives. Let this be the chief end of hearing God's Word, that we may yield a more exact Obedience to his Commands,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> and <hi>grow wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this End, let us conclude all with our affectionate and fervent Prayers to God, that he would be pleas'd to inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our Underſtandings, open our Hearts, and incline our Wills, and to render his good Word effectual to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Ends for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, that we may not be only bare
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103240:94"/>
               <hi>hearers of the Word, but doers of the ſame.</hi> Let us praiſe and magnifie his Name, for the many gracious Opportunities he has given us of entring his Courts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his Sanctuary, that we have the Liberty of Worſhipping him in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and enjoy the glorious Light of his Goſpel, whilſt ſo great part of the World ſit <hi>in darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.10.</note> And let us not only content our ſelves with making a verbal Acknowledgment of theſe Favours; but teſtifie our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by a conſtant Attendance on his Worſhip and Word, and making it the ſtanding Rule for the Government of our Lives and Converſations.</p>

Thus a careful Phyſician preſcribes ſafe and beneficial, though unpalatable Medicines to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eas'd Patient; and thus God deals with Mankind, mercifully and bountifully, and frequently denies his Requeſts and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of Kindneſs to him, that he may furniſh him with thoſe things which are more ſafe, and more convenient for him. This is an uſeful Leſſon, and to be learn'd from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Experience, as 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Text, and the two preceding Verſes. <hi>Leaſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure, through the abundance of Revelation, there was given unto me a thorn in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103240:96"/>me, And he ſaid unto me, my Grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee:</hi> So that the words of the Text are an Anſwer to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prayer, wherein God inſtead of delivering him from the buffeting of Satan, which was the thing he pray'd for, Promiſes to give him his Grace to endure it, which would be far more commodious and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> That I may Diſcourſe with the greater Profit upon theſe words: I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What it is which God Promiſes. <hi>His Grace.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="3">III. The Perſon to whom it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, to the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul. My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if God ſhould have ſaid thus unto him; I will not anſwer thy Requeſts, in exempting thee from thy manifold Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Afflictions; but leaſt thou ſhouldeſt be oppreſt by them, I will give thee what is more expedient for thee, to wit, <hi>my Grace which is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is which God Promiſes, <hi>viz. his Grace:</hi> Which taken in the general, denotes the Power and Efficacy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, renewing the Soul to the Image
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103240:96"/>of God, and continually ſtrengthning, and guiding it in Obedience to his Will. Now from the ſame Spirit proceeds Diverſity of Grace; there is <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> or the miraculous Unction of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby to one is given the Gift of Miracles, to another ſpeaking with Tongues, to a third Prophecying; but this is not the <hi>Grace</hi> meant in the Text,

And thoſe excellent Gifts and Endowments with which this Apoſtle was furniſh'd, tended to puff him up, and expos'd him to the Buffettings and Temptations of the Devil: But that Grace which upheld and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and <hi>was ſufficient for him;</hi> was what the School-men call <hi>Gratia gratum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens;</hi> or the Grace of Life. Such as are all the ſaving Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, which are wrought by his Help and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the hearts of Believers, ſuch as Faith, Hope, Charity, Purity, Humility, and all other gracious Habits of the Mind, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the fruit of the Spirit,</hi> and wherein the Image of God,

<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note> This is that Grace which <hi>renders us acceptable unto God,</hi> and is in effect <hi>eternal Life unto us.</hi> This is that Grace which is beſt deſcrib'd by its Effects,

The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and proportion of this Grace; 'tis ſuch as is ſufficient to enable us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go whatſoever God ſhall pleaſe to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.23.</note> For ſince that God who gives <hi>this Grace,</hi> is in himſelf All-ſufficient, therefore there is no queſtion, but that the Aſſiſtance which he affords, will be ſufficient to bring about thoſe Ends for which he gave it. God's Grace ſanctifies all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Souls, all the Powers of our Body; it is <hi>ſufficient</hi> in every State and Condition of Life, it cheers us in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it reſtrains us in Proſperity, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering us, either to be puft up with the one, or to droop under the Burthen of the other. It is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Remedy againſt all Temptations, and fortifies our Souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſorts of Batteries.
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> When we are afflicted, it tells us, That <hi>our Sufferings here are not worthy to be compar'd with that eternal weight of Glory,</hi>

               <hi>which ſhall be reveal'd in us;</hi> or if we abound in Bleſſings, or in Gifts natural, or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, it tells us from whence they came, and to what end they were beſtowed upon us, that we muſt not hide theſe Talents in a Napkin, or abuſe the Grace of God unto Wantonneſs, but promote as much as in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103240:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>us lies the Glory of God, the good of our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and the eternal Welfare of our own Souls. Tho' we offer up our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God without preſent Returns, or apparent Succeſs, it tells us, That God forbears to give us thoſe good things we ask for, that he may try our Patience and Perſeverance; and ſince he doth not ſee it expedient to grant them, therefore 'tis our Duty to wait the Determination of his good Pleaſure. Again, God's <hi>Grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> for all Perſons; our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo merciful, that he ſhines as well upon the bad as the good; <hi>of his full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all receive Grace for Grace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.9.</note> And tho' the Grace of God is not imparted to all alike, yet every Man receives a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> Portion of it, ſufficient to ſupply all his Wants, both Temporal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. For as if you dip Veſſels of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sizes into the Sea, every one will be full of Water, though every one doth not hold the ſame quantity, ſo tho' there are different Gifts, and different Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and different meaſures of Grace communicated to Men; yet God with-holds from no Man ſufficient Grace, to enable him to be good and vertuous, and to anſwer all his preſſing and unavoidable Neceſſities. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> gathered <hi>Manna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 16.18.</note> according to every Man's eating,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103240:98"/>when they did meaſure it with an <hi>Omer,</hi> he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gather'd little had no lack: So God gives his <hi>Grace</hi> unto Men, according to every Man's neceſſity; meaſure it with an <hi>Omer,</hi> weigh all the Circumſtances and you will find, That neither he that has little has Cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, nor he that has much, to boaſt. One Man is ſurrounded with Temptations, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd and loaded even to the ground with Afflictions, oppreſs'd with Difficulties, and to this Man God gives a greater Portion of his holy Spirit, he aſſiſts him more powerfully, he ſtrengthens and confirms him after an extraordinary manner, and enables him to cloſe and grapple with the Difficulty or Temptation which aſſaults him. Another has been nurtur'd in Vice, and brought up in Debauchery, and it is neceſſary, that he ſhould be reclaim'd from his Evil doings, with a ſtrong hand, and an out-ſtretch'd Arm. A third has been long accuſtom'd to good, and is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd to Sobriety and Vertue, and requires only the ordinary Aſſiſtance of God's Grace to keep him ſo. Thus God like a Wiſe Houſholder proportions his Gifts to the Wants, and Neceſſities of his Children and Servants, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of every one according to what he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103240:99"/>has receiv'd, and reward them according to their Works; he that has but one Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent given him, if he well employs that one, may obtain <hi>the Government of one City;</hi> though he has not the higheſt place in the Kingdom of Heaven; yet he will find Admittance there, where the leaſt degree of Happineſs, will conſiſt of Joys unſpeakable, which tranſcend all compariſon. But if God call out any one to give Teſtimony to the Truth, or to be an eminent Example of Patience or Long ſuffering, or taking up the Croſs, he will furniſh him with proportionable meaſures of Strength; ſo that the good Chriſtian may reſt aſſur'd, that though at preſent he finds himſelf weak and frail, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to undergo the Affliction, which he fears will ſuddenly fall upon him, yet I ſay he may aſſure himſelf, that the Divine Aſſiſtance will always attend him, God will never leave him, nor forſake him, but as his troubles grow upon him, ſo ſhall he be ſupply'd with more Power, more Courage, and more Ability, to bear up under them. <hi>God is faithful,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note> 
               <hi>and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able to bear,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us. And that God has been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the performance of this, as well as his other Promiſes, we need no other Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that of our own Conſciences. For if
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103240:99"/>we look back upon the paſt Tranſactions of our Lives we ſhall find, how frequently <hi>God's Grace</hi> has ſuggeſted to us, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it,</hi> when we were in ſuſpence how to behave our ſelves; and has as it were Pointed out our Duty to us; how often we have been <hi>prick'd at the heart,</hi> when we have committed any Sin, and ſtir'd up and incited to do good; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we have done amiſs, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd God's Commands has generally been, becauſe we have not improv'd thoſe good Motions, and followed the Dictates and Impulſes of <hi>God's Grace</hi> within us. For tho' we are not to look for any other Directions, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our Lives, beſides thoſe of God's written word; and if we have any thing ſuggeſted to us, which is oppoſite to this eſtabliſh'd Rule of our Duty, we ought to look upon it as a ſnare of the Devil, and the Inſtigation of an evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Yet on the contrary, when we find any vigorous and ſtrong Inclination to do that, which we are fully aſſur'd is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do, at that time, and in that place; then we may aſſure our ſelves, that this is the Motion of God's holy Spirit, the Grace of God working in us, and that 'tis our Duty to comply with it, to encourage and improve it; and if we do ſo then, it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103240:100"/>will certainly bring to paſs that Effect, for which God at the firſt deſign'd and intended it. It remains therefore, That <hi>God's Grace is ſufficient for us,</hi> (i. e.) gives us Strength, Ability, and Means enough to ſubdue the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; and that if we are brought under the Dominion, and Power of any of theſe, we muſt accuſe our own Sloth, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, in neglecting to uſe and improve to the uttermoſt, thoſe means and helps which God has afforded us. This will be made more evident by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Perſon to whom this Promiſe is made, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> And if we conſider the Perſon here ſpoken of (the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>) according to that account which is given of him in the Holy Scripture, we ſhall find in his Life, ſuch variety of Circumſtances, ſo very remarkable and inſtructive, that there is hardly any Condition we can fall into, wherein we may not receive Benefit by his Example, and have an Inſtance of the Powerfulneſs, and <hi>ſufficiency of God's Grace.</hi> Let us conſider him as a <hi>Jew,</hi> how zealous was he in the Profeſſion of that Faith, how furious in the Perſecution of all ſuch, who either taught or liv'd in the Obſervance of the Chriſtian Religion?
<note place="margin">Acts 23.6.</note> He was <hi>a Phariſee the Son of a Phariſee.</hi> And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103240:100"/>a rigid Obſerver, not only of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, but alſo of all the Traditions of the <hi>Rabbies;</hi> ſo that though he liv'd at that time, when our Saviour Chriſt was on Earth, and had heard of, if not ſeen, the Miracles which he wrought, yet was he an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemy to him and his Religion. And this miſtaken Zeal for the Moſaical Law carried him forth to a furious Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Church; he was conſenting to the Death of the Martyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 22.20. Acts. 8.3. Acts 9.1.</note> 
               <hi>He made havock of the Church,</hi> and <hi>breathed out nothing but threatnings, and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples; dragging Men and Women to Priſon,</hi> and procuring Letters of Inquiſition againſt them from the High Prieſt; and yet for all this, <hi>God's Grace was ſufficient to bring him from the bondage of the Law, to the Freedom of the Goſpel, and the only Righteouſneſs in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> to make him Preach that Faith, which he formerly perſecuted, and from an Enemy, to become a Martyr for the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Conſider him now as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and then you will find him remarkable for the exact Government of his Life, his Graces, his Afflictions, his Infirmities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was remarkable for his auſtere Life and Converſation. Like one who ſtrove for the Maſtery, he abſtain'd from all things
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103240:101"/>which might hinder him in his Chriſtian Courſe,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27. 1 Cor. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>beating down his Body, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into ſubjection, he labour'd more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than all the reſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> travelling from Nation to Nation, from City to City, never wearied with Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, never baffled with Oppoſition, never tired with diſputing, and all this thro' the <hi>Grace of God which was ſufficient in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 If you would take a Survey of his Graces you may read, That <hi>he propheſied, he ſpake with Tongues, he wrought Miracles;</hi> what ſhall I ſay, he was enlightned, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with an abundance, an Exceſs, a multitude of Revelations; <hi>he was caught up into the third Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.4.</note> 
               <hi>and heard words which it was not poſſible for Man to utter.</hi> Theſe were ſuch Privileges, ſuch evident Demonſtrations that he was belov'd of God, and a Favourite of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that nothing could keep him from being puft up with them, but an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meaſure of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> with which he was endow'd. And as <hi>God's Grace was ſufficient for him</hi> in Proſperity; ſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Did it ſupport him in a day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and Affliction; he was, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tells us,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>in ſtripes above meaſure, in Priſons frequent, in Deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received he forty ſtripes ſave one, thrice was he beaten with rods,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103240:101"/>once was he ſtoned, thrice he ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, a night and a day he was in the deep: in Journeyings often, in perils of Waters, in perils of Robbers, in perils by the Heathen, in perils by his own Countrymen, in perils in the City, in perils in the Wilderneſs, in perils in the Sea, in perils amongſt falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; in Wearineſs and Painfulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold and Nakedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And at laſt after Forty years Perſecution, he was beheaded at <hi>Rome;</hi> had not the <hi>Grace of God been ſufficient for him,</hi> he could not have ſuffered ſo courageouſly, nor have gloried in his Sufferings with ſuch Chriſtian Bravery, nor have promis'd himſelf the Crown of Righteouſneſs, with ſuch an earneſt Hope, and ſtedfaſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, we have his Infirmities; there was ſent him a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Chryſo. <hi>the Iliack Paſſion.</hi> Tertul. <hi>the Head-ach.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>ſome Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>as the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him,</hi> by which ſome of the ancient Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſome bodily Diſeaſe and Infirmity; but the generality of Interpreters, with more Probability affirm, That by this <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh</hi> is meant, not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evil, but all manner of Temptation, by which the Devil ſtrove either to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Faith, or to beat him from it. And that he might get the better of all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103240:102"/>theſe, and be more than a Conquerour, God Promiſes him his <hi>Grace,</hi> and aſſures him, that it ſhould be <hi>ſufficient for him;</hi> and we find by the Conſequence, that it had its deſired Effect; <hi>This Grace of God was ſufficient</hi> to keep him humble, when he beheld the moſt glorious Revelations, and was rapt up into the third Heaven, to ſupport him amidſt the moſt grievous Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and Afflictions, to ſtrengthen and confirm him under Temptations, and tho' by earneſt Prayer he could not obtain a preſent Deliverance from his Temptations, yet by the Grace of God he reap'd the Fruit and Benefit of them; an Addition of Grace and ſpiritual Strength, whereby he was enabled to obtain the Victory over them in this World, and an eternal, and never-fading Crown of Glory in the next.</p>
            <p>And now what remains, but that we make a right Improvement of all theſe Conſiderations, and direct our Thoughts from the Contemplation of theſe words in the General, to conſider the influence they ought to have on our particular Lives and Converſations. And to this end I ſhall endeavour to draw ſuch Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as naturally flow from the Truths already deliver'd. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the Intereſt of every Man to ſtate the Caſe plainly between God and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103240:102"/>his own Soul, and to examine his own Heart, whether he has got ſaving Grace or no; for ſince this alone is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſupport a Man in Affliction, and to keep him ſteady under all the Turns and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of humane Affairs, it certainly behooves every one to be well aſſured, that he is poſſeſs'd of this Jewel of great Price; eſpecially ſince 'tis ſo frequently counterfeit ed, and Men are ſo ready to impoſe upon themſelves, and deceive their own Souls, and to embrace the ſhadow of Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Subſtance. <hi>Try and examine well your ſelves, know you not your own ſelves,</hi> that you muſt have this <hi>true ſaving Grace of God,</hi> unleſs ye are Reprobates. Take heed all things are not according to the outward appearance; <hi>the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> often transforms himſelf into <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light;</hi> A Man may hear, and read God's Word, and pray frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and yet not have the true Gift of Underſtanding, and Spiritual Wiſdom; He may (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Give his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be burnt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and all his Goods to feed the Poor,</hi> and yet not have the Gift of Love; he may have a Faith ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains, and yet be nothing; he may have <hi>all Knowledge and all Prophecies</hi> and the tongue of Men and Angels to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and yet be only <hi>a ſounding Braſs,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103240:103"/>and a tinkling Cymbal.</hi> But a true <hi>ſaving Grace</hi> will diſcover it ſelf by ſuch Effects as theſe, by a ſincere Love to God, a fervent Charity to your Neighbour; and a ſober Meekneſs in the Eſtimation of your ſelves. If you have a ſincere Love to God, you will avoid Evil, and do Good out of ſuch Principles and Motives as theſe; becauſe the one is pleaſing, the other hateful in the ſight of God, becauſe Sin debaſes our Nature, and provokes God to withdraw his Grace from us, and grieves his Holy Spirit. If you have fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Charity to your Neighbour; you will Love him for God's ſake, becauſe he enjoyns it, and maintain an univerſal Charity for all Men, as well Enemies as Friends;
<note place="margin">Luk. 6.13.</note> 
               <hi>you will Love thoſe who hate you, bleſs thoſe who Curſe you, and pray for thoſe who deſpitefully uſe you, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you.</hi> If you have ſober Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a juſt Valuation of your ſelves, you will have a low and mean Opinion of your Self, and your Performances, and readily acknowledge your own Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and be ſenſible of your Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and confeſs that naturally you are <hi>inſufficient for every good work;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> and that 'tis from <hi>God's Grace alone that you are what you are:</hi> You will rely on the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy of God, and the ſole Merits
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103240:103"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, and pray inceſſantly for the continuance of God's Favour and Aſſiſtance, without being puff'd up with an over-weening Opinion of your own Abilities, or caſting an envious Eye, or a diſdainful Look on the Attainments of other Men. Theſe are the Chief and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Fruits of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and are the neceſſary Effects of <hi>ſaving Grace:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> And if after a diligent Search, and ſerious Enquiry, it plainly appears, that you are poſſeſt of theſe Qualifications, you may then, and not otherwiſe be ſecure, that you have truly <hi>God's Grace,</hi> even the <hi>Grace of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If you find you have <hi>true Grace,</hi> endeavour to cheriſh and encreaſe it: For though God has promiſed, <hi>That his Grace ſhall be ſufficient for us;</hi> yet this is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made good only to ſuch Perſons, who perform the Condition annexed to it, that is, who joyn their own Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with it. This is the Duty on our part to be perform'd, which if neglected will intercept the Emanations of <hi>God's Grace,</hi> grieve the Holy Spirit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to depart from us, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us; if therefore we would keep that <hi>Grace</hi> which God has given us, we muſt cheriſh and improve it, we muſt hearken to its Motions, obey its Commands, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103240:104"/>with its Councels, and pray that God would continue and encreaſe it to us. Let us Pray for all ſuch Mercies, both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Spiritual as we ſtand in need of, but let us make our moſt fervent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Addreſſes at the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> for the Bleſſed Influences and Aſſiſtances of God's Holy Spirit; and beg of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that he would be pleas'd to give us <hi>his Grace,</hi> to enlighten, aſſiſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in all our Exigences, and to teach and enable us, to make a due Uſe and right Improvement of all other Mercies. Thus much in the General, but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us learn to be thankful for that meaſure of <hi>Grace,</hi> which God has beſtow'd upon every one of us; ſince 'tis ſuch as God ſees <hi>ſufficient</hi> for us, and as much as will enable us to work out our Salvation. <hi>If David</hi> can ſlay the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> with a Sling and a ſtone, what need has he of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour? If God enables us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he requires of us, what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion have we for any irreſiſtible Impulſe, or any force upon our Wills: When we may be ſav'd like Rational Creatures, by God's <hi>Grace</hi> in Conjunction with our own Endeavours, why ſhould we expect to be driven on by a blind Inſtinct or Fatality? If our Gifts are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſubdue our
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103240:104"/>Spiritual Enemies, and obtain Heaven, we ought to be content, and thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſce in the Bounty of our good God, and liberal Benefactor. We are taught indeed <hi>to covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> and to ſtrive continually <hi>to grow in Grace;</hi> but having done our Endeavours, we ought to reſt ſatisfy'd with that Meaſure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Grace, which God is pleas'd to impart to us. If our Neighbour has greater Gifts than we have, it's a Sign that he has made more uſe of them, that his N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceſſities are greater, his Duties, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Tryals more weighty, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and troubleſome; whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have <hi>ordinary Grace,</hi> let us nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repine at God, nor be dejected in our ſelves, nor envy others: Or whether we have <hi>extraordinary Grace,</hi> let us not forget God, or be puft up,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.11.</note> or deſpiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for <hi>this diverſity of Gifts proceeds from the ſame Spirit, diſtributing to every Man as he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us hence learn to endure Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Afflictions patiently. For though our Afflictions at the firſt ſight appear never ſo grievous and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet God has promis'd, that he will lay no more upon his Servants than they are able to bear; he will proportion his Aſſiſtance to their Wants, and give them
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103240:105"/>Strength to undergo that Burthen, he is pleas'd to lay upon them, <hi>His Grace will be ſufficient for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What good Man can undergo greater Troubles and Calamities than St. <hi>Paul</hi> did? And yet through the Grace of God, he was not only ſupported under them, but he arriv'd to ſo high a Degree of Truſt and Confidence in God, as to make them mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy and Satisfaction, and to Glory in them: Where that long Catalogue of Afflictions is introduc'd with this Preface; <hi>Seeing that many Glory after the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.18.</note> 
               <hi>I will alſo Glory.</hi> And let us but ſummon up our Chriſtian Courage, and Reſolution, let us but put forth that Strength which God has given us, and pray to God fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unceſſantly to give us his Grace and Bleſſing; and there can no Affliction befall us, which we ſhall not be enabled to go through with and at laſt ſee a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and Comfortable end of it; we ſhall receive the benefit of it in this World, and obtain the Reward of our Patience in the next. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. and Laſtly, We may from hence learn to refer the Succeſs of our Prayers unto God. If we do not preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Anſwer to our Petitions, let us not deſpond or conclude, that God either doth not hear, or will not grant a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103240:105"/>Anſwer to our Requeſts; for there may be many Reaſons, why God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the giving us thoſe Mercies we pray for, and ſometimes to deny us thoſe things which we think good and convenient for us: Perhaps there may be a Defect in our Prayers, we may not have pray'd with ſufficient Fervency, Piety, and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Perhaps the thing we pray for, is not expedient for us, or God ſees it will be more for our good to be without it; and in all theſe Caſes, though he denies our Requeſts,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.9.</note> yet he conſults our benefit and advantage. <hi>Let us not therefore be weary of well doing,</hi> conſidering, <hi>That at laſt we ſhall reap if we faint not, our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will return into our Boſoms</hi> loaden with Bleſſings. And in the mean while, it may be ſufficient to ſupport and comfort us, to conſider that God deals with us after the ſame manner he did with many holy Men, and eminent Saints, whoſe Examples are recorded in the Holy Scripture for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; <hi>David,</hi> tho' <hi>a Man after God's own Heart,</hi> yet by much Weeping, Faſting, and Praying,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> could not obtain the Life of his Child. And <hi>Samuel</hi> though a Prophet of the Lord, could not prevail with God to continue the Kingdom upon <hi>Saul</hi> and his Poſterity. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.1.</note> though one of the Apoſtles of our Saviour Chriſt,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103240:106"/>and though he not only <hi>pray'd thrice;</hi> but <hi>offer'd up vehement Supplications and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> could not obtain an Exemption from the <hi>buffetings of Satan.</hi> When therefore we offer up our Prayers, and Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, let us always make our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts with Reſignation, and Submiſſion to the Divine Pleaſure, and after the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, annex this Condition to all our Petitions; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs not as I will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> 
               <hi>but as thou wilt.</hi> And then if God doth not ſee fit to give us the Bleſſings we pray for, he will give us ſome better thing inſtead of them: Or if he doth not deliver us out of that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or Trouble we groan under, he will beſtow upon us a ſuitable Meaſure of <hi>Grace</hi> to ſupport us under it. Either of theſe Conſiderations may be a ſufficient Encouragement to place our Truſt and Confidence upon God, and to Perſevere in our Addreſſes at the Throne of his <hi>Grace.</hi>

            <p>IT was deſervedly look'd upon, as one of the chief Excellencies of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Laws, that they did not ſo much deſign the Puniſhment of Wickedneſs and Vice, as the uſing means to prevent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it, that by a careful Education of Youth, in the Principles of Vertue and Morality, they took away the Cauſe of all inordinate Deſires and Affections, and render'd their Duty ſo familiar, and habitual to them, that they had no need of thoſe terrible Tortures, and Bloody Executions, whereby other Law-givers frighted their Subjects into Obedience. And of this Nature is the Duty recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,

               </note> 
               <hi>To keep our Hearts.</hi> Now the Heart has different Acceptations in the Holy Scripture; 'tis ſometimes taken for one Faculty of the Soul, and ſometimes for another; for the Underſtanding, the Will, the Affections, the Conſcience, and ſometimes for the whole Soul. I ſhall take it in the moſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Sence, and then it will denote to us all the Thoughts; and Inclinations, the Paſſions and Affections of the Soul. For 'twas the Opinion of the Ancients, that the Heart was the Seat of the Soul, and the Inſtrument of its moſt noble Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So that by <hi>keeping the Heart</hi> is meant, a looking into the moſt private Receſſes of our Soul, a curious and particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation what is tranſacted there; the taking a view of all our Inclinations, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Deſires, and Affections, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with the Rule of God's Word, approving thoſe which are Good, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowing thoſe which are Evil. It denotes alſo the making uſe of ſuch Means, as may be effectual to bring our Souls into a due Frame and Temper; the taking Care that the Thoughts of our Hearts, may not be taken up with any unlawful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or drawn out too far on any ſenſual Pleaſure, or worldly Advantage; but that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103240:108"/>we ſincerely deſire, and heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to render them entirely conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>Not that it is poſſible for the beſt, and moſt Holy Men, to govern their Hearts ſo exactly, as never to tranſgreſs the ſtrict Rules of their Duty, or never to offend in Thought: Alaſs! Vain and ſinful Thoughts will continually ſpring up in our Minds, they are the neceſſary Effects of our deprav'd Natures, and the Devil will take all Opportunities of inciting them in our Souls, and preſenting ſuch tempting and alluring Objects to our Phancies, as will produce inordinate Affections, and Deſires. 'Tis not in our Power, and therefore it cannot be our Duty, ſo to <hi>keep our Hearts,</hi> as that no vain Thoughts ſhould intrude themſelves there: Whilſt we continue in theſe frail Bodies, and Houſes of Clay, we ſhall be ſubject to many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Fumes which ariſe from our inferiour Appetites will cloud our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and in ſome meaſure capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our Reaſon. 'Tis plain and Evident, that many of our Thoughts proceed from the Frame and Conſtitution of our Bodies, and do in a great meaſure depend on the preſent Circumſtances we are in, and the Objects we converſe with. If we are of a cold and Phlegmatick Conſtitution, we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103240:108"/>ſhall be affected with Melancholy, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful Thoughts, and Phancies; if of a Cholerick Temper, Paſſion will ſometimes get the upper hand of us; when we are at Eaſe and in Proſperity, our Thoughts will be apt to be too gay and volatile; if in Pain or Miſery we muſt needs be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and poring on it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that a good Chriſtian can do, is to Endeavour to <hi>keep his Heart,</hi> in as good a Frame as he poſſibly can, to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on his Guard; and though he cannot attain to Perfection in this Life, yet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after it, by curbing his unruly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, governing his Affections, and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites by the Laws of Reaſon, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they break out, and Act irregularly, reducing them within their due Bounds, and not allowing or delighting in the leaſt ſinful Thought, or ſuffering it to dwell or remain in our Hearts, but caſting it out with all ſpeed and Indignation ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. And this muſt be done</p>
            <p n="2">II. With all Diligence, which denotes theſe two things. 1. That this Duty ought to be our conſtant Employment, that we do not let any day ſlip without examining the Frame of our Hearts; for if we ſleep never ſo little, <hi>The Evil one will take the Opportunity of ſowing his tares in our Souls,</hi> if we are not always upon
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103240:109"/>our Guard, the Cares and Buſineſs of Life, or the Pomps, and Vanities of the World, will imprint either ſuch light and gariſh, or ſuch Melancholy, and diſtracting Ideas of things in our Minds, as will produce a fruitful Crop of Vain, Sollicitous, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts: This muſt be the buſineſs of every day, for the Thoughts of our Hearts are apt to be diſorder'd with every Guſt of Paſſion, and will require a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye, and a continual Care, to keep them in any tolerable Order. 2. <hi>The keeping our Hearts with all Diligence,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the greateſt Intenſeneſs, and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mind imaginable. For we muſt take a great deal of Pains to come to a through knowledge of the thoughts of our Heart. <hi>The Heart of Man is deceitful, and deſperately wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> 
               <hi>who can know it?</hi> Which Text, though primarily intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Difficulty of knowing what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men think, or what Opinion we ſhall have of things hereafter; as appears by the coherence of the Words with thoſe which went before, yet they may well ſerve, to intimate to us the Difficulty of giving an impartial Judgment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sentiments of our Minds, and what the true bent and Tendency of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and Affections are; for we are ſo fond of our <hi>Boſom ſins,</hi> and thoſe <hi>darling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:103240:109"/>which either Cuſtom or Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has endear'd to us, that we think we can never ſufficiently careſs them; and though our Affections are drawn out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt extravagant manner after them, yet we cloath them with ſuch plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſpecious Pretences, as make the moſt criminal Enjoyment of them appear (at leaſt to us) harmleſs and lawful. Who is there that will not readily acknowledge that we ought to Love God, with the moſt intenſe and zealous Affection, <hi>With all our Soul, and with all our Strength,</hi> and the good things of this World, in a lower and ſubordinate Degree? and yet how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a Task would it be to perſuade the moſt ſordid and miſerable Worlding, That <hi>his Affections are not plac'd on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, but on things below?</hi> and though he is notoriouſly guilty of this Vice of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and ſees the Folly of it in other Men, yet is he not able to turn his Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to diſcover it in himſelf; ſo great Diligence and Induſtry doth it require, to range over all the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Hearts, and to be acquainted with all thoſe crooked Paths, which Sin and Error have made in our Souls. And if there is ſo much Diligence requir'd to know the thoughts of our Hearts, it muſt needs call for our utmoſt Care to manage
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103240:110"/>them aright, and keep them in due Order. And therefore there will be the more need to conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Motive made uſe of in the Text to engage us, to the Performance of this Duty. <hi>For out of them are the Iſſues of Life, (i. e.)</hi> our Happineſs both in this Life, and the next doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diligent and conſcientious Diſcharge of this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Happineſs in this World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By keeping our Hearts,</hi> we ſhall learn to manage our Affairs with Prudence and Diſcretion. For the greateſt part of thoſe extravagant Actions which Men commit, proceed either from the want of a due Deliberation before they enter upon Action: Or, a diſcreet executing what their Reaſon tells them, is fit and ought to be done. Either they are hurried on by the Violence of their ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and head-ſtrong Paſſions, or byaſs'd by ſome inordinate Luſt, and corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and theſe betray them into indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, abſurd, and ſinful Words, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now he that is accuſtom'd <hi>to keep his Heart,</hi> conſiders well and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately every Circumſtance of an Action, before he puts his Thoughts into Excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103240:110"/>he weighs firſt his own Power and Ability, and then enquires both into the Lawfulneſs, and Expediency of the thing he undertakes; by which means he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids thoſe Rocks upon which ſo many ſplit, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Raſhneſs in ſetting upon thoſe things he has neither Power nor Skill to perform on the one hand, and a too great Diffidency, and diſtruſt of his own Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the other: The firſt of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Shame and Diſappointment, when a Man finds himſelf not able to compaſs the End he aim'd at, and falls ſhort of his too bold and daring Deſigns; the ſecond deprives him of many valuable Benefits and Advantages which lie in his way, and require only the Pains of ſeeking after them, and poſſeſſing himſelf of them. And in truth ſince all our Words and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the Streams, which flow from the Fountain of our Hearts, therefore it muſt needs follow, that he who governs his Heart wiſely and prudently, cannot go far aſtray in his Words and Actions, all our vital Operations will ſavour of that Root and Principle from whence they proceed; and a Holy Life muſt needs be the neceſſary Effect of a ſanctified Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A due Government of our Hearts, will produce Peace, and quiet of Mind, by freeing us from thoſe raging Paſſions, and ſenſual Affections, from proud, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103240:111"/>and envious Thoughts, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb our Peace and Quiet, and render our Lives uneaſie and burthenſome to us. For it has been an old, and a very true Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that Content and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by conſequence Happineſs in this Life, doth not proceed from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Goods of this World, or the indulging our ſelves in ſenſual Pleaſure, but from the Temper and Conſtitution of our Minds; in a contentedneſs and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with that Condition, the wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God has allott'd us, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Enjoyment of thoſe good things he has made our Portion in this World. A ſound Mind in a ſound Body, was the wiſe Wiſh of a Heathen Poet; for that Man whoſe Heart is full of Envy or Malice, or ſollicitous Care, or Pride, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie on a Throne, and miſerable amidſt the moſt plentiful affluence of worldly Enjoyments, but he who has obtain'd the <hi>Art of Governing his Thoughts,</hi> by the Laws of Reaſon and Religion, will enjoy the Pleaſure of a quiet and compos'd Mind, amidſt all the noiſe and hurry of this World, and remain contented and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with his Condition, without caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either an envious Eye on the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe who are above him, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful Look on thoſe who are in a meaner Condition than himſelf. From hence will flow,</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:103240:111"/>
            <p n="3">3. Peace of Conſcience;
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.21.</note> for <hi>if our Hearts condemn us not then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God,</hi> that Man who has been ſo careful, as to ſet a ſtrict and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Watch over his Thoughts, will be from thence aſſur'd, that his Heart is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right towards God, and has good grounds to believe that he is in his Favour, and under his Protection, and this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greateſt Joy and Satisfaction ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; and therefore 'twas good Advice which the Oracle gave <hi>Craeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the way to be Happy is to know thy Self; for a through Knowledge of our own Hearts, and the Government of our Thoughts according to the Rule of God's Word, is a chief Ingredient, as well as the principal Cauſe of a happy Life in this World.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the bleſſed Effects of <hi>Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Hearts</hi> as to the Concerns of this Life; but if we conſider, 2. Its influence on our eternal Happineſs, we muſt needs judge it highly reaſonable to uſe our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Care and Diligence in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Duty. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God has made the <hi>Keeping our Hearts</hi> one part of our Duty. The words of the Text are not only a prudential Councel containing Matter of Advice, but a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103240:112"/>Command; God expects we ſhould comply with it, and yield our Obedience to it. 'Tis true, the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Thoughts were not ſinful, unleſs immediately Blaſphemous againſt God, and therefore they did not blame the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Heart to commit Murder or Adultery, unleſs 'twas actually put in Execution; which we have the leſs reaſon to wonder at, becauſe there are ſo many amongſt us, who maintain this abſurd Opinion, and Fanſie their <hi>Thoughts are ſo free,</hi> that they ſhall never be call'd to Account for them; if they can but Act ſo cunningly as to eſcape the Cenſures of Men,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.21.</note> if they can but ſpeak <hi>words ſmoother than Oil,</hi> they are not at all ſollicitous how their Hearts ſtand affected. But let theſe Men conſider,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> that at the laſt day <hi>when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men,</hi> we ſhall be call'd to an Account for all <hi>the Thoughts and Intents of our Heart,</hi> as well as for the loudeſt Words, and moſt publick Actions; in God's Book not only the Members of our Body, but the Thoughts of our Mind are written; and therefore we are commanded, <hi>not to make Proviſion for the Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to contrive before-hand, how we may fulfil our ſinful Appetites and Deſires. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103240:112"/>Thought of Fooliſhneſs is ſin, (i. e.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 2.4 9.</note> 
               <hi>a fooliſh Thought)</hi> and that <hi>a Man of wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, or Thoughts God will condemn.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 12.2.</note> And St. <hi>John</hi> affirms,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.15.</note> That <hi>whoſoever hates his Brother,</hi> or retains any Rancour or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in his Heart <hi>is a Murderer:</hi> Now as on the one hand, God will accept of the ſincere Intention of thoſe Perſons, who fail in their Obedience only for want of Power and Ability, to perform what he has commanded them: So on the other, our Thoughts may be ſinful in the ſight of God, though we have neither Will nor Power to put them in Execution. <hi>Abraham</hi> only intended to Sacrifice his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.17.</note> and this holy Purpoſe of his Heart <hi>was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18.12.</note> and when <hi>Sarah</hi> diſ-believ'd the Promiſe of God, and derided it in her Heart, ſhe is ſaid to laugh within her ſelf, and God reſents the Provocation. And though 'tis true, that when a wicked Thought is put into Execution, and breaks out into a wicked Act,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.15.</note> when <hi>Luſt has conceiv'd and brought forth Sin,</hi> 'tis of a far more heinous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deeper Dye, than when it was only an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or in the Birth; yet in many Reſpects our Thoughts may be more wicked, than either our Words or Actions can be. For, 1. Our Thoughts are more numerous than our Actions. There muſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103240:113"/>be many Preparatory Motions of the Mind, many Thoughts twiſted together, to produce one deliberate ſinful Action: How many Plottings and Contrivings, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Hopes, Wiſhes and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, muſt go before the Commiſſion of every evil Deed? There muſt be firſt a Scheme erected in our Minds, the Means and Methods muſt be reſolv'd on, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments muſt be choſen, and the thing frequently acted over in our Thoughts, before any notorious ſinful Action can be committed. 2. The ſame Sin may be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over a thouſand times in the Mind, which can only be once perform'd in the outward Action. We may take a great deal of Pleaſure and Delight in recalling the Sins we have formerly committed, in repreſenting them in our Fancies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting them over in our Imaginations, and hereby draw down a freſh Guilt upon our ſelves. Nay, 3. We may be guilty of thoſe Sins, by contriving them in our Minds, which can never poſſibly be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted; thus the Covetous Man may rob his Neighbour of his Wealth, though he never obtain the Poſſeſſion of it, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and Revengeful may murder his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, when out of his reach, and the Cruel and Blood-thirſty may imagine all Mankind to have but one Neck, and then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103240:113"/>cut it off,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note> and the Atheiſt may <hi>ſay in his Heart there is no God,</hi> and fancy him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the World. From theſe, and ſuch other Conſiderations 'tis obvious to conclude, That we are not left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to think as we pleaſe, but that the Government of our Thoughts is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and indiſpenſable Duty. Nay ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary is it to our eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare to <hi>keep our Hearts,</hi> that no Word or Action can be good or acceptable unto God, which doth not proceed from a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Heart. A wicked Man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many Acts of Juſtice and Charity, but if they do not proceed from a good Diſpoſition of Mind, they are only <hi>ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida peccata,</hi> counterfeit Vertues, and therefore the Apoſtle tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> That <hi>if we give our Goods to feed the Poor, and have not Charity, (i. e.)</hi> a ſincere Love to God, and our Neighbour (which is ſeated in the Heart) all thoſe good Deeds will profit us nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Keeping of our Hearts,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to our eternal Happineſs, becauſe the maintaining our Communion with God depends on it. Now our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God is maintain'd by our offering up Prayers and Praiſes unto him, and his Acceptance of them, and beſtowing on us, the bleſſed Influences of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103240:114"/>and if ſo, then what Sacrifice of Prayer and Thankſgiving can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, which is offer'd up from a Heart full of impure Deſires and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reeking with Luſt, or Anger, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? He is a pure and holy Spirit, and <hi>delights to dwell in a humble and contrite Heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.15.</note> and if our Hearts are infected with Envy, Malice, Pride, or Luſt, we ſhall grieve him, and he will depart from us, and then the Devils thoſe impure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will take Poſſeſſion of our Souls, they will become <hi>a Cage of theſe unclean Birds,</hi> a fit Habitation for theſe Legions to dwell in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A right Frame of Heart is a Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation abſolutely neceſſary, to render us capable, of enjoying eternal Happineſs, in the Life to come. For our Happineſs in the other World, will in a great meaſure depend on the Preparations we have made for it in this: Our Life here is a State of Probation and Trial, a ſmall Span of time allotted us, to furniſh our ſelves with vertuous Habits, and Divine Qualities, (thoſe wedding Garments) which will render us welcome Gueſts at the Marriage of the Lamb. And therefore if we would have any well-grounded Hopes of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the other World, we muſt make it our Employment here; to reſtrain our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103240:114"/>Paſſions, moderate our Affections, enflame our Hearts with Zeal and Devotion, and accuſtom our ſelves to holy Meditation; theſe are Qualifications abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make us reliſh the Pleaſures of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Life. For we may with as good Reaſon hope to ſatisfie our Hunger with precious Stones and Diamonds, or our Thirſt with the ſight of ſtately Buildings, or goodly Apparel; as that a malicious, envious, luſtful, or covetous Perſon, (whilſt he continues ſo) ſhould take delight in the <hi>Beatifical Viſion,</hi> and in ſinging Praiſes and Hallelujahs unto God. So neceſſary is it, that we cleanſe and purifie our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Affections, to qualifie and diſpoſe us for eternal Happineſs, as well as for the Happineſs of this Life. I come now in the laſt Place,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To add ſome Directions to facilitate this Duty to us, and to aſſiſt us to govern our Hearts aright.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be diligent and induſtrious in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of your lawful Calling. For every Man either has or ought to have ſome lawful Employment or Calling, in the Exerciſe of which he ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote the Glory of God, and to be a uſeful Member of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in which he lives; thoſe who by the Eminency of their Birth, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103240:115"/>of their Fortunes, move in a ſuperior Orb, and ſeem to be freed from that Original Curſe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>of getting their Bread with the ſweat of their brows,</hi> are ſo far from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from it, that as they have more Talents committed to their Truſt, ſo their Accounts will be the greater at the laſt day. Now by Diligence in our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Callings, we ſhall keep our Minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon their proper Objects; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by raiſe up uſeful, and profitable Thoughts in our Souls. Nay we may improve the Buſineſs of our Callings, to adminiſter occaſion for devout and holy Meditations. <hi>Thoſe who go down to the Sea in Ships</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſee the Works of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.23.</note> 
               <hi>and his wonders in the Deep.</hi> The Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whilſt he weighs his Wares, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that all his Thoughts, Words, and Actions, <hi>are weigh'd in the Balance of the Sanctuary;</hi> the Husbandman when he Tills the ground may call to mind, <hi>What long Furrows the Scourges made on the back of our Saviour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 129.3.</note> when he beholds his Crop, it may put him in mind of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that as the Corn periſhes in the ground, and ſprouts out again more green and freſh than it was before, ſo our vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, after they are buried in the Grave, ſhall ariſe at the laſt Day in greater Glory and Splendour; when he gathers his Grain
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103240:115"/>into his Barn, he is put in mind of the Day of Judgment, when the Good ſhall be taken up into Heaven, and the Wicked <hi>like chaff ſhall be burn'd with unquenchable Fire:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 3.12.</note> Thus the Buſineſs of every Man's particular Calling, whatſoever it is (I have here given only the moſt obvious Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) may be improv'd to raiſe up Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts; and the Mind may be, and for the moſt part is, beſt imploy'd, when the hands are at work. On the contrary, there is nothing more fruitful of vain and ſinful Thoughts, than Sloth, and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for our Thoughts are reſtleſs, and in perpetual Motion, and will grind one upon another,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 33.27.</note> if they have no good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi>Idleneſs teaches much evil</hi> (ſays the wiſe Son of <hi>Syrach</hi>) ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies have it <hi>all evil.</hi> The Devil thought the fitteſt time to tempt our Bleſſed Saviour was, when he was alone, and in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> and that ſaying of <hi>Cato</hi> was ſubſcrib'd to by the wiſer Heathens as an Oracle, <hi>nihil agendo, male agere diſces:</hi> for when Men have nothing to do, the Devil will be ſure to find them Employment: And therefore it ought to be our Care, even when we unbend our Minds from more ſerious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and allow our ſelves thoſe Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the frailty of our Natures, and our good God has indulg'd us in, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103240:116"/>our Minds on ſuch harmleſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Recreations, as may render them more active, and our Bodies more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the Service of our Maker.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next to Idleneſs, let us avoid bad Company; for 'tis a common and true Obſervation, that a Man may be known by the Company he keeps; Converſation wins inſenſibly upon us, has the moſt endearing Charms, and makes the moſt laſting Impreſſion upon our Minds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Check wicked Thoughts at the firſt appearance, and let us not ſuffer them to dwell in our Hearts, for the ſooner we caſt them out, we ſhall do it the more eaſily; every moment we ſuffer them to remain there, they will grow more powerful, and the Difficulty will encreaſe by the neglect of our Duty. If therefore we find in our Hearts <hi>any wicked Imagination, that exalts it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.5.</note> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Rules of our Duty; let us maintain no Treaty with it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it ſaying,
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.20.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not a little one,</hi> but put it out of our Minds, as ſoon as poſſibly we can. The Devil will be continually ſuggeſting evil Thoughts into our Fanſies, and ſolliciting us with the moſt alluring, though pernicious Objects; he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſturb us in our Devotions, by diverting our Affections, and turning the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103240:116"/>Current of our Thoughts on our worldly Affairs, and caſting into our Minds, vain and ſinful Imaginations; theſe are thoſe <hi>Birds of Prey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 19.11.</note> which attend the moſt pure and holy Sacrifice: But then 'tis our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to drive them away, and not to harbour, or allow of any thought in our Minds, which we ſhould be aſham'd to have diſcover'd in our Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To incite us to the performance of this Duty; let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What Pains wicked Men take to get rid of good Thoughts. If they happen into Company, where good Diſcourſe and pious Admonitions, have made ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon their Minds, if ſome Truth is ſet home upon their Conſciences, by ſome good Book, or awakening Sermon, or they happen to be put in mind of their latter End, and a Judgment to come, by a fit of Sickneſs, or the Death of ſome Friend or Relation, or any other ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Emergency; how reſtleſs are they till they have got theſe Thoughts out of their Minds, and are rid of theſe uneaſie Companions? Do they not run from one Buſineſs to another, from one Diverſion to another, and turn every ſtone, to ſtill the Clamours of an accuſing Conſcience? ſhall not we uſe our utmoſt endeavour to caſt out ſinful and wicked Thoughts, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103240:117"/>take as much Pains to be happy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebras fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis tuis perſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeris, Deus lumen eſt.</hi> Tertul. Heb. 4.12.</note> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do to be wretched and miſerable? Conſider farther, That God ſees and takes notice of all our Thoughts, <hi>He pierces even to the dividing aſunder of the joynts and marrow: And diſcerns even the moſt hidden Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi> Now if the Sinner is ſo effectually aw'd, and deter'd from his Sin, by the Preſence of ſome grave Perſon, who remarks and over-ſees his Doings; how dares he allow himſelf in wicked Thoughts, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that the great God of Heaven and Earth looks down upon him, and <hi>beholds the Intents and Purpoſes of his Heart;</hi> that at the laſt Day all his moſt ſecret Thoughts ſhall be expos'd to the view of Men and Angels, and wrote in ſuch legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that the whole World may read them. To both theſe add this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; conſider what has been the Event of harbouring evil Thoughts in our Minds, what the iſſue has been, and in all Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood will be? Did not all the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Sins you ever committed in your Life-time, begin in your Heart? were they not forg'd and contriv'd there? And how can you tell, but that the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one wicked Thought, may be the Riſe of the moſt villanous Act? No Man was ever wicked all of a ſudden. The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103240:117"/>at firſt is timorous and baſhful, and goes on by Degrees, till at laſt he arrives at the higheſt Pitch of hardneſs, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency. Many a Man there is, who thinks it can be no heinous Offence to caſt a covetous Eye on other Mens Goods, or a wanton Look on his Neighbours Wife; and yet whoſoever doth not reſtrain theſe evil Affections of his Mind, will ſoon lie under an unavoidable Temptation, to commit the groſſer Acts of Theft and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery; for if we allow our ſelves in the lighter Breaches of our Duty, we ſhall ſoon come to think every Sin to be ſo, and wicked Thoughts harbour'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, will produce wicked Actions. Had <hi>David</hi> at firſt ſuppreſs'd his luſtful Thoughts after the Wife of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> he had never added the Murder of the Husband to Adultery with the Wife; but when once he gave way to ſinful Thoughts, this Man after God's own Heart, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, as well as great King was born down the Stream of his vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and committed the vileſt Acts of the moſt preſumptuous Sins. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore with thy ſelf, that though a vain and wicked Thought is a Sin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, when it enters into our Mind, without our Conſent and Approbation, yet we ſhall very much encreaſe the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103240:118"/>Guilt, when we allow our ſelves in it, and it may prove very dangerous to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If ſinful Thoughts ſtill preſs into our Minds, divert them to ſome holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and take this hint of bending your Thoughts to the contrary Duty. Thus if you are tempted to plot and contrive the Commiſſion of any Sin, make this the Occaſion of fortifying, and ſtrengthning your Reſolutions againſt the Commiſſion of that very Sin; of conſidering its evil Nature, and dangerous Conſequences, and hereby encreaſe your Hatred and Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Are the ſinful Pleaſures which you have formerly enjoy'd, repreſented to your Fanſie? Let the Remembrance of them renew your Sorrow and Repentance, for your diſobedience to God's Law, and the Breach of his Commandments, and put you upon begging God's Grace and Aſſiſtance, that for the time to come, you may live more uprightly, and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Are you perplex'd and troubled with blaſphemous and Atheiſtical Thoughts? Fall preſently on the Contemplation of the wonderful Works, which he has made, and the curious Operations of his hands, conſider this ſtupendious Fabrick of the World, the infinite Variety, and yet exact Order, and due Subordination of Beings
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103240:118"/>contained in it; ask thy ſelf, what Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it was which firſt created it, and ſtill continues to preſerve it, which has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd irrational Creatures with unerring Inſtincts, that teaches the Bird to build its Neſt, the Spider to weave its Web; look into the curious Frame and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that leſſer World thy own Body,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.14.</note> and behold there, how <hi>fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thou art made.</hi> And by ſuch Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations as theſe affect thy Mind with a humble Awe and devout Reverence of God's Power and Majeſty. Are you tempted to Envy the Proſperity of your Neighbour? Conſider how many Gifts of God's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you have receiv'd, how much you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more than you deſerve, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful and ungrateful you have been for thoſe good things, God has already given into your hands. Are you given to luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts? Turn this ſtrange Fire into a Holy Zeal for God's Glory. Do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Thoughts riſe up in your Heart? Conſider your former Sins, and repeated Provocations againſt God, and take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from hence to exerciſe your Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Are you overwhelm'd with Deſpair? Call to mind God's gracious Promiſes, and admire his infinite Goodneſs, who has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his only begotten Son, and ſent him into the World on Purpoſe to atone for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103240:119"/>your Sins, and to accompliſh the great Work of your Salvation, and ſtill makes you the Proffers of Pardon and Forgiveneſs; by ſuch Meditations as theſe, you will <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate your heavenly Father,</hi> in drawing Good out of Evil, and make the Temptations of the Devil, the occaſion of promoting your eternal Welfare. Nay, if you thus <hi>reſiſt the Devil he will flee from you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 4.7.</note> his Aſſaults will be neither ſo frequent, nor ſo furious, when he finds they ſerve only to exerciſe your Graces, and make you more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seaſon thy Heart every Morning with ſome Holy Meditation, Dedicate the Firſt-fruits of thy Thoughts unto God. <hi>How precious are thy Thoughts unto me O God</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt) <hi>how great is the ſum of them?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>If I ſhould count them, they are more in number than the Sand: When I wake I am ſtill with thee.</hi> The conſtant and ſerious Meditation, on thoſe great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a Holy Life; the Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, the Torments of Hell, the Joys of Heaven, the certainty of Death, the Terrors of Judgment, if made the Subject of our Morning Meditations, would be a Spring and Source of good Thoughts all the day long, and produce in our Minds, ſuitable Deſires and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and to this End let us conſtantly read
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103240:119"/>ſome Portion of the Holy Scripture, <hi>This will be a Lamp to our feet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.115.</note> 
               <hi>and a light to our Paths;</hi> it will both inform our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what we ought to do, and incline us to walk in the Way of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Let us beſeech Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God that he would give us his Grace, and enable us with the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, to <hi>Keep our Hearts,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Deſires and Affections. And though this Duty is too difficult to be perform'd by our own Strength, yet we may be aſſur'd, that God will enable us to go through with it, becauſe he requires nothing of us, which is not in our Power to perform. He has promis'd,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.3.</note> That <hi>he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax,</hi> but that he will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage every Effort that we make towards a good and vertuous Life. His Grace was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny'd to any one, who did but ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire it, and endeavour to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of receiving of it,
<note place="margin">Luk. 6.38.</note> 
               <hi>To him that asks it ſhall be given,</hi> not only what he prays for, but alſo the larger Effuſions of his Holy Spirit, he often prevents our Prayers, and is more ready to give, than we are either to deſire or receive.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:103240:120"/>
            <p>And now what remains, but that we being furniſh'd with theſe Helps, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of the Aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, immediately ſet upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Duty; and endeavour with all Care and Diligence imaginable, to keep a ſtrict Watch over the Thoughts and Affections of our Hearts. 'Tis true, this cannot be perform'd without much Pains and Induſtry, but what Deſign which is either great and glorious, uſeful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, can be compaſs'd without La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and yet we have this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that every day will make it more eaſie, the greateſt Hardſhip is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: But when we have accuſtom'd our ſelves to pious and devout Meditations, they will become more delightful to us, than the moſt voluptuous and ſenſual Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. We ſhall take more Pleaſure in meditating on God's Word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating <hi>thoſe Joys which are at God's right hand,</hi> and will be the Lot and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bleſſed in Glory, than we could do in an earthly Paradiſe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there can be no greater Happineſs on this ſide Heaven, than that which the pious and devout Soul enjoys, when he is enflam'd with Zeal, and tranſported with Devotion, when with St. <hi>Paul</hi> he is as it were <hi>caught up into Heaven,</hi> on
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103240:120"/>the Wings of Contemplation, and receives the earneſt of the <hi>Beatifical Viſion.</hi> Theſe are Joys beyond the Ken of a ſenſual Mind, and the peculiar Rewards of thoſe Perſons, who have prepar'd themſelves, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Hearts capable of receiving them, by cleanſing them of all ſinful and impure Luſts, and decking and adorning them with Holy Affections and Deſires. With theſe Men the Holy Spirit will take up his abode, and where he dwells there muſt needs be Love, and Peace, and Joy unexpreſſible: This is the moſt Bleſſed Condition we can attain to in this Life, and the ſureſt Mark and Token, that we ſhall be eternally Happy hereafter.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103240:121"/>(as they think) preſently adds a Rule for the Government of our Actions; hereby intimating to us, That our Prayers and Endeavours ought to go hand in hand, and that when we pray to God for thoſe things we want, we ought to make uſe of the Means which God has appointed for the obtaining them. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, and affords us matter of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Advice, but upon reading the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall find, that this Connection ſeems to be rather ſtrain'd and extorted from the Text, than the natural Deſign of the inſpired Pen-man; and therefore I ſhall rather look upon theſe Words as an intire Propoſition, containing matter of Advice, how we ſhould behave our ſelves towards our Neighbour: And the rather becauſe 'tis obſerv'd that this Particle <hi>(therefore)</hi> is often redundant, and ſerves only to paſs from one Subject to another, and in the <hi>Syriack Verſion,</hi> 'tis wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. As to the Occaſion of theſe words, 'tis highly probable, that they were deſign'd to oppoſe the groſs Miſtake of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much on the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Jewiſh Law, as to prefer them before the Works of Juſtice, and Mercy, as may plainly be gathered from the thirteenth Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:103240:122"/>the twenty third and twenty fourth Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And therefore we find the Prophets ſo earneſt in exhorting them to Works of Juſtice and Mercy, proving that theſe are the great Lines of our Duty,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.11.</note> and that in Compariſon with theſe, the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law were of little value or worth.
<note place="margin">Amos 5.22.</note> And the ſame Deſign is carried on by our Saviour in the Text; he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take them off from being too nice and ſuperſtitious in the Obſervance of the Ceremonial part of the Jewiſh Law, and to engage them in the purſuit after real Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the Practice of the Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Religion. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, do ye ſo unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Diſcourſe upon theſe Words, I ſhall Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Meaning and Deſign of this Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall mark out its Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall recommend it to your Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by ſhewing its Uſefulneſs and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall conclude with ſome few Reflections on what has been ſaid in the preceeding Diſcourſe.</p>
            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:103240:122"/>
            <p n="1">I. As to the Meaning and Deſign of theſe words. They are certainly an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to that firſt Principle of Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which God has implanted in all animate Beings. Irrational Creatures are guided to it by Inſtinct <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of Divine Providence, but Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is directed by Reaſon, which teaches them to ſeek after thoſe things which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Being, and by neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which contribute to their Well-being and Happineſs in this World. Now ſince our Well-being and Happineſs in this World doth conſiſt in the Enjoyment of thoſe agreeable Objects, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our Appetites and Deſires, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of right Reaſon; And ſince the ſame Objects produce the ſame Inclinations, and Paſſions in all Men; therefore from hence will reſult an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Obligation of dealing by all Men, as we our ſelves would deſire to be dealt withal, if we were in their Condition and they in ours; for ſince we ſhould neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily deſire ſuch and ſuch things, if we were in the ſame Circumſtances our Neighbour is in, therefore 'tis but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that we ſhould grant him the ſame things when in our Power, which we ſhould expect from him, if he were in our Circumſtances, and we in his. This
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103240:123"/>therefore is an univerſal Rule of Juſtice and Equity, and made uſe of by our Saviour Chriſt, to ſupply the Defects of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws which he has laid down in his Holy Goſpel, that when we are at a loſs how to Act (either becauſe the Action is not determin'd in the Holy Writ, nor have we any plain Precept for the performance of it, or when we ſuſpect that our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and corrupt Inclinations have clapt a byaſs upon our Reaſon, or when we would diſcover the due meaſure of our Actions, and with what agreeable Circumſtances they ought to be perform'd) then we may appeal to this diſ-intereſs'd Judge, which God has plac'd in our Boſoms, and demand boldly of our ſelves; how we ſhould deſire to be dealt with, and what we might reaſonably expect, if we were in the ſame Condition our Neighbour is in. For the Holy Goſpel has not provided par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws of equal extent, with all the Actions of humane Life, nor given Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how, and in what manner, and in what meaſure, every Circumſtance of an Action ought to be perform'd: If this were attempted we might well ſay, <hi>That the World it ſelf could not contain the Books which ſhould be written.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 21.25.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel only Chalks out to us the great Lines of our Duty, it commands
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103240:123"/>the Practice of the moſt neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſuch as are thoſe which are enjoyn'd in this and the preceding Chapters, and leaves our Reaſon to work out what ought to be done upon particular and caſual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies, to direct in ſome Caſes what is lawful, and in moſt what is prudent and expedient: And for our greater Security has laid down ſome general Rules, which if ſeriouſly conſider'd, and carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, will be ſufficient to direct our Reaſon in all its Judgments, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Thus in Relation to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table which principally concerns the Worſhip of God, the Holy Goſpel commands us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.24, 24.</note> 
               <hi>To Worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> to direct our Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God alone, through one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and ſeveral other particular Precepts it gives us, as to the neceſſary and Eſſential parts of Divine Worſhip. But our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how to behave our ſelves as to the Circumſtances of Worſhip, are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to this general Rule.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40.</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order:</hi> And thus in Relation to the Duties of the ſecond Table, which concern our Neighbour; our Saviour has laid down many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Precepts, in this admirable, tho' ſhort Epitome of Morality, his Sermon on the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103240:124"/>Mount, and then Cloſes all with this Rule of univerſal Influence, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The End and Deſign then of this Rule, is to teach us how to behave our ſelves towards our Neighbour, which is the moſt difficult and moſt neglected part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For we are generally ſo much byaſs'd by Self-Love, that when any Controverſie is ſtarted, in which our own Intereſt is concern'd, we are very nice and exact in Claiming what belongs to us, and is our due; but when the Scales are turn'd, and 'tis our Duty to weigh and conſider, what our Neighbour may juſtly expect from us, then we make uſe of falſe Weights and Meaſures, and too often determine direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the plain Rules of Juſtice and Honeſty. We are not ſo apt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in learning this Leſſon of Charity, as we are ſevere Maſters in exacting it from others. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall mark out the Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of this Rule, and conſider the juſt extent and Latitude of theſe words. <hi>Whatſoever ye would,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis evident, that this Rule is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to the Duties of the ſecond Table;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103240:124"/>for ſo 'tis limitted in the very words of the Text. <hi>'Tis whatſoever ye would, that</hi> Men <hi>ſhould do unto you,</hi> &amp;c. Some there are indeed, who would have this Rule extend alſo to the Duties of the firſt Table, and to be the meaſure of our Duty towards God, but this without the ſupport of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Reaſon; for though Religion may properly be ſaid to be Juſtice towards God; becauſe all the Service which we owe, and are able to pay unto God, is highly juſt and reaſonable, and what is but our bounden Duty and Service; yet the diſtance is ſo great between an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect Being, and us Poor, vile Worms, <hi>His Works are ſo wonderful, and his ways paſt finding out,</hi> that 'tis utterly impoſſible, and 'twould be the higheſt Preſumption for us, to weigh our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſame Balance with his. Theſe words are therefore limitted to the Duties of the ſecond Table, as may be plainly made out from that parallel Place, where our Bleſſed Saviour being ask'd this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<note place="margin">Matt. 22.3.</note> 
               <hi>Maſter which is the great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law?</hi> Returns this Anſwer, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and this is the firſt and great Commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it, Namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> And then adds, <hi>on theſe two
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103240:125"/>hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Where we may ſee that this Rule is made to be the Sum and Subſtance only of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Rule is determin'd to thoſe things which tend to the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Neighbour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reads the Words, <hi>Quaecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que bona,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatſoever</hi> good things <hi>ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo to them.</hi> For there are ſome Men of ſuch envious and malicious Tempers, that they would willingly undergo any ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity themſelves, on Condition that their Enemy might endure the ſame; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own Houſes to be burnt, that his might periſh in the Flames; nay, loſe one of their own Eyes, that he might be depriv'd of the like Advantage. Like the pretended Mother of the living Child, would ſay;
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 3.26.</note> 
               <hi>Let neither of us have it, but let it be divided.</hi> Others there are of ſo proud and churliſh a Diſpoſition, that they ſcorn to be oblig'd, and had rather be without a Benefit, than to be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it to one they hate: Such a Man as this would ſooner die than owe his Life to an Enemy, and in regard to theſe Men this Rule muſt be underſtood thus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that any Man</hi> (not this or, that particular Perſon) <hi>ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:103240:125"/>
            <p n="4">4. If we would put the Caſe right, we muſt ſuppoſe the Circumſtances to be the ſame between our Neighbour and our ſelves. For one different Circumſtance will very much alter the Nature of an Action, thus upon Suppoſition, that I am ſtronger, and more healthy than my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I may be willing that he may do ſome things to me, which if I ſhould do the ſame to him, would tend very much to his Prejudice and Diſadvantage. A rich and wealthy Man may be willing, that others ſhould with-hold their hands from doing him good, that he might have the ſame Excuſe, to deny his charitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the Poor. Nay, meer difference in Opinion may make it unreaſonable, that I ſhould deſire ſome things of ſuch a Man, which he might very reaſonably demand of me, and I ſhould readily comply with.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt take Care in applying this Rule, that our Deſires be reſtrain'd to thoſe things, which we have juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable cauſe to expect from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and then this Rule will run thus. <hi>Whatſoever ye have juſt and reaſonable cauſe to deſire that any Man in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto them.</hi> For every Malefactor, who is Sentenc'd to Puniſhment for his Evil Deeds, would willingly have his Puniſhment remitted,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103240:126"/>and the Judge himſelf would deſire it, if he was in the ſame Circumſtances and a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal at the Bar: But yet it is not juſt and reaſonable, that all Criminals ſhould be pardon'd, for this would make the Law it ſelf u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eleſs, by relaxing the co-ercive Power of it, and render Magiſtrates cheap and contemptible, when they are no longer ble to be <hi>a Terror to evil Doers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.3.</note> but only Encouragers of thoſe who do well.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt conſiderable Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which Caſuiſts have affix'd to this Rule, to which all the reſt may eaſily be referr'd; which being duly underſtood, and conſiderd and will prepare my way,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To incite and encourage you, to the Practice of this Rule; by ſhewing the Excellency, and Uſefulneſs of it, in all the different Emergencies of Life. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a Rule plain, and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. A Rule which lies Level to every Capacity, the moſt plain and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Perſon may comprehend it, and yet 'tis worthy the Study and Obſervance of the Wiſe and Learned, there is no need of turning over huge Volumes, of Learning the Languages, Cuſtoms, and Manners of other Nations, every one that will but look into his own Conſcience, will find this Rule engraven there. Other Laws
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103240:126"/>are perplex'd with innumerable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpun out into nice and curious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and depend much upon Cuſtoms, and Uſages in the Practice of them, ſo that it requires much Study and Pains to attain to any competent meaſure of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in them; but this is as ſoon learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as comprehended, and as ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as ſeriouſly conſider'd; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing, but an ordinary Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to underſtand it, and an honeſt heart to put it in Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a moſt juſt and reaſonable Rule.

'Tis true, that 'tis not found in expreſs Words, in the Canonical Books of the Old Teſtament, but yet it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known to the Jews,
<note place="margin">Levit. 19.18. Deut. 16, 11, 12. Pſal. 7.4.</note> both becauſe we may find there many Precepts of the ſame Import, and in the Apocryphal Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> an Expreſſion very near of kin to it, <hi>Do that to no Man which thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> (who had theſe words frequently in his Mouth, and was ſo taken with them, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them to be wrote in his Courts of Judicature) is ſaid to have had them from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103240:127"/>the Jews and Chriſtians, of whom he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a more favourable Opinion, meerly on this Account. But not to depend ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Authority, it's plain, that this Rule is ſounded upon that firſt Principle of ſelf Preſervation: For ſince every Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to preſerve himſelf in being, and to live as eaſie and comfortably as he can; we cannot reaſonably expect that other Men ſhould part with thoſe good things we ſtand in need of, unleſs we give our helping hand to ſupply their Wants. For though Men are plac'd in different Ranks and Stations in this World, yet do they naturally depend one upon another, and mutually contribute to the Weal of the Community, the one cannot ſay to the other, <hi>I have no need of thee;</hi> but the Poor is as uſeful to the Rich, as the Rich is beneficial to the Poor: And therefore, 'tis highly reaſonable, that every Man ſhould endeavour to be as uſeful, and aſſiſtant to others, as he expects they ſhould be to him. For what Reaſon have I to expect that another Man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my Happineſs, but upon ſuch Grounds and Principles, as make it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as reaſonable, and neceſſary for me to contribute to his? What Privilege, or Prerogative can any one Man imagine himſelf, to have above the reſt of the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103240:127"/>World, that all Men ſhould agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make him Happy, without any reſpect to their own Intereſt and Welfare? Can we imagine any Man to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for another Man's ſatisfaction than his own? Or to be better pleas'd in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Man happy, than to be ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Since therefore every Man doth in the firſt place, deſire and ſeek after the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his own Being, and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep himſelf in as eaſie and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Condition as poſſibly he can, and ſince this cannot be effected without a mutual Participation of thoſe good things which other Men are poſſeſs'd of; it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the way to induce them to part with thoſe good things which would be uſeful to us, is reciprocally to contribute to the ſupply of their Neceſſities; and the moſt juſt and equitable Rule of governing our Actions towards them, is placing our ſelves in their ſtead, and conſidering what we ſhould reaſonably expect from them, if we were in the ſame Wants, and under the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a Rule of univerſal Influence. A Rule which will ſerve at all Times, and for all ſorts and degrees of Perſons, and may be apply'd to all Exigences, and will reach all ſorts of Caſes depending between us and our Neighbour. 'Tis a Rule which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103240:128"/>will ſerve the Peaſant,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſcop. Inſtitut.</hi> Theol. p. 249.</note> as well as the Prince, and obliges the Prince, as well as the pooreſt Subject. It teaches Inferiours to pay Reſpect and Submiſſion to thoſe who are in a higher Station, becauſe they do expect it from thoſe who are below them; it teaches Superiours to be kind, and beneficent to their Inferiours, and to afford them ſeaſonable Help, Counſel, and Relief, becauſe they look for theſe good Turns, from thoſe who are above them; and it engages every one to be kind and faithful to his Equals, that hereby he may purchaſe their Love and Fidelity towards him; it engages Magiſtrates to diſtribute Juſtice impartially, becauſe they would think it their due, to be protected both in their Life and Eſtate, and would be deſirous, to be ſecured from all Wrong and Violence, if they were private Men. Nay, this Rule will not only teach us to give every one his due, becauſe we do expect to receive our due from others, which is ſtrict Juſtice: But hereby every Man may Erect a Court of Chancery in his own Breaſt, and conſider when, and how it comes to paſs, that ſtrict and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Juſtice becomes the higheſt Injuſtice; when we ought to proceed according to the Letter of the Law, and when, and in what Caſes it allows of ſome Mitigation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103240:128"/>and Relief: In ſhort, there is hardly any Caſe in which we are doubtful, how to behave our ſelf towards our Neighbour, in which we may not be directed by the Application of this excellent Rule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is a Rule by which we ſhall be Judg'd both here and hereafter.
<note place="margin">Matt. 7.2.</note> 
               <hi>For with what Judgment we judge, we ſhall be judg'd; and with what meaſure we mete, it ſhall be meaſur'd to us again.</hi> That which induc'd the Heathens to obſerve this Rule, was an awe and dread, that the future Event of their Actions, ſhould be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with their preſent Dealings with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men. And in truth we have many remarkable Inſtances, both in Sacred and prophane Authors, of God's dealing with Men according to their Works, and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſuch Puniſhments on them in this World, as exactly ſquare with their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and hereby as it were pointing out to others, that this was the very Cauſe why they were inflicted. When we read that <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged on the very ſame Gallows, that he cauſed to be Erected for poor <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezek (who cut off the Thumbs and Great Toes of Threeſcore and ten Kings, and forced them to gather up the Crumbs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Table)</hi> had the ſame Calamity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him,
<note place="margin">Judg. 1.7.</note> we have good Reaſon to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103240:129"/>believe, that the Reflection he made was true. <hi>As I have done, ſo hath the Lord requited me;</hi> we cannot but take notice that God's Juſtice bears pace with theſe Men's Sins, and that they receiv'd the juſt demerit of their Offences: But where Juſtice is ſlow-pac'd, and doth not ſeize the Sinner in this Life, it will certainly overtake him at the laſt, and at the great Day of Account, when we ſhall all ſtand before God's Tribunal, the chief Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be made; how well we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd this Rule, whether we have been Converſant in works of Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>in feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 25.36.</note> 
               <hi>comforting the afflicted,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch as our Behaviour has been, ſuch will our Sentence be.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to recommend this excellent Rule laid down in the Text to your Practice, becauſe it is the moſt plain and eaſie Rule, highly juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, of univerſal Uſe, and ſuited to all Conditions and Circumſtances, of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and the Rule we ſhall be judg'd by, both here and hereafter. I come,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And Laſtly to conclude, with ſome few Reflections on the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And,</p>
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:103240:129"/>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall take notice, That the Way to do good to our ſelves, is to do good to others. For ſince we are all the Members of one Body, of which Chriſt is the Head, whatſoever one Member enjoys, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Members partake of the Benefit. Every good Deed which we perform is an Addition to the common Treaſury, in which every one has a ſhare and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And the more Good any Man doth, the ſtronger Claim he has to the help and aſſiſtance, Love and Friendſhip, of other Men. A truly good and beneficent Man, is a Benefactor to all Mankind; becauſe his Love extends to all, though he has not always an Opportunity, or Ability of exerting it; and this Divine Quality has ſuch endearing Charms, that it muſt needs attract the Love and Friendſhip of others, the Benefits which he beſtows enrich him, and return into his own Boſom: So that the words of the Text will be found true even in this Senſe; that the way to make our ſelves Maſters of the Affections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, and to ſecure to our ſelves their Help and Aſſiſtance in a time of need, or to obtain from them thoſe things we deſire, is to make our ſelves as uſeful and beneficial to them, as our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will permit. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye ſo unto
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103240:130"/>them,</hi> &amp;c. From whence we may inferr,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no Pretence of any Injury receiv'd, can be a reaſonable Cauſe for our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it; or for our doing Evil to other Men. Their unjuſt Dealings with us, ought to be no Standard, nor will they be any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excuſe, for our Dealing with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner; for 'tis not whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men have done to you: But <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you.</hi> Now there is no Man would willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Injury either in his Body, Goods, or Reputation; and therefore he ought to be careful, that he doth none to other Men: And if he doth receive any Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from them, to take Care that he is not provok'd to reſent it ſo far, as to be Guilty of a more heinous Crime, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of it. For to return an Injury, renders a Man more blameable, than at firſt to inflict one: For he that doth an Injury to another Man, doth not conſider of what pernicious Conſequence his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Action is, he doth it raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly, he is blinded with Paſſion, and though he Wills the Action, yet proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he may diſown the ill Effects which it produces: But he that returns an Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, doth not only ſin knowingly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, but wilfully and obſtinately, in oppoſition to his own Senſe and Feeling, he plainly perceives all the evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103240:130"/>of the Action, he is ſenſible of them, and has ſmarted under them, and yet he goes on maliciouſly to execute his Revenge. 'Tis therefore our unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Duty, either to paſs by Injuries, and take no Notice of them if ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, or generouſly to forgive them, and by heaping Coals of kindneſs upon the Heads of our Enemies, endeavour to melt them down into Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; unleſs in ſome particular Caſes, where ſome Circumſtances render it more adviſable, to remit them to the Umpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From hence we may inferr of what vaſt Importance it is, that this Rule ſhould be ſeriouſly conſider'd, and Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly practis'd. For as on the one hand 'tis plain, that the greateſt part of thoſe Miſchiefs which happen, either to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, or to private Perſons, do in a great meaſure proceed from our neglect of this Rule: So on the other 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that a careful Obſervation of it, would wonderfully conduce to their Weal, and flouriſhing Condition. With reſpect to Communities 'tis evident, That were Men once let looſe from the Obligation of this Rule, the World would be fill'd with Blood-ſhed, Rapine, and Oppreſſion; every one would ſeize on what beſt pleas'd
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103240:131"/>him, and the ſtrongeſt Arm would have the greateſt ſhare: But ſince every one is deſirous to retain, and enjoy thoſe good things which he doth poſſeſs, hence 'tis that he finds it neceſſary to joyn with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their mutual defence. Not but that Man is naturally a Political Creature, and takes delight in the mutual Society, and converſe of reaſonable Beings like himſelf; and therefore Mankind would have form'd themſelves into Societies, tho' the World had continued in its Original Innocency, and Violence and Oppreſſion had never enter'd into it: But yet ſince the Fall, our Natures are ſo deprav'd, and we have degenerated ſo far from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rank of Beings, in which we were plac'd, that had not Men ſome Awe of this Rule upon their Minds, there would be no poſſibility of living in the World: And if 'tis neceſſary to the Eſſence of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much more to its Well-being; for do not all our mutual Correſpondence, and friendly Converſe depend on the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe Vertues, which naturally reſult from the Obſervance of this Rule; ſuch as are Veracity in our Words, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to our Truſt, Juſtice in our Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the like. And thus as to the Concerns of particular Perſons, is it not obvious that this Rule when duly obſerv'd,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103240:131"/>directly tends to root out all Envy, Paſſion, and Malice from the Hearts of Men; to take away the Cauſes of Differences, and Animoſities, and to promote Peace and Quietneſs, and a good Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Neighbours and Acquaintance? would it not be effectual to ſecure us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fraud, Oppreſſion, and Injuſtice? Would it not beget Comfort and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in our Minds, and prove of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Force and Efficacy, to ſupport us under all the Troubles and Afflictions, which can poſſibly befall us in this <hi>Vale of Tears?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the Benefits which would flow from a due and conſcientious Obſervance of this Rule, only to name them would take up more time than I have now left, and therefore I ſhall remit this Subject to your private Meditations, though the beſt way to Frame an adequate Notion of them, would be to put this Rule in Practice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us admire the infinite Goodneſs of God, who is pleas'd to govern us by ſuch Laws, as are highly juſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and tend to promote our Happineſs, both in this World, and the next. He doth not impoſe on us ſuch Arbitrary Commands, as carry with them no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they ſhould be obey'd, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Will of the Impoſer; but the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103240:132"/>Goodneſs of his Nature inclines him, to give us ſuch Laws, as ennoble our Natures, and make us more like himſelf, and more capable of that Happineſs, which he hath prepared for us, as the Reward of our Obedience. He firſt places in us a natural Inſtinct to Love and preſerve our ſelves, and then makes this both the Meaſure and Motive of loving others: So plain and evident is it, that God deſigns the Good and Welfare of his Creatures, becauſe he makes their Deſires, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of their Duty; and his Commands are agreeable to their natural Inclinations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, how unexcuſable ſhall we be left, if we do not live in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of this excellent Rule. For had God laid a more weighty Burthen upon us, had he commanded us all thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Obſervances, which the Jews under the Law were oblig'd to perform; <hi>A yoak which they were not able to bear:</hi> Or all thoſe Mortifications, and that Auſtere way of Living, which ſome poor Miſtaken Chriſtians impoſe upon themſelves; yet we ſhould have had Inducements ſufficient to perform all this: Heaven and eternal Happineſs would have made amends for the hardeſt uſage we could have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in this World: But when God has laid upon our Shoulders, ſo good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103240:132"/>a Yoak, ſuch Juſt reaſonable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable Commands, ſo agreeable to our Natures, and ſo much for our Intereſt; what can we ſay for our ſelves? What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can we make, if we do not comply with them? Can any thing be more reaſonable, than to do by others as we would have others do by us? And yet the Obſervance of this Rule, comprehends the chiefeſt part of our Duty. Even thoſe who are moſt backward in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it themſelves, yet are generally very rigid in exacting it from others: There is no Man but would willingly be comforted in a time of Trouble, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a time of Danger and Calamity, reliev'd in a time of Want and Sickneſs, though he neglects the performance of theſe Duties towards his Neighbour. What Anſwer then ſhall we make at the great Day of Account, when an Inquiry ſhall be made, whether we have viſited the Sick, fed the Hungry, or cloathed the Naked, and relieved the Priſoner, and in ſhort, whether we have <hi>done Juſtice and lov'd Mercy?</hi> How dreadful will that Sentence be which ſhall paſs upon thoſe Men, who have neglected theſe Duties? And if thoſe Perſons ſhall be condemn'd, who have neglected them, who have barely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the performance of them, where ſhall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103240:133"/>thoſe Men appear, who have practis'd the quite contrary? Who have oppreſs'd the Poor and Needy, circumvented and defrauded their Neighbour, and have went on during the whole Courſe of their Lives; in Acts of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; contrary to the Checks of their Conſciences, and the known Rules of their Duty? Certainly God will pour out the full Vials of his Wrath upon theſe Men, and <hi>give them their Portion with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God grant that we may not be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in their Guilt, and then we ſhall not undergo the ſame Puniſhment: but that by a conſcientious Obſervance of this Rule, <hi>of doing by others, as we our ſelves would deſire to be done unto;</hi> we may obtain the end of our Hopes, and the Fruit of our Obedience; the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
